Brain Anatomy-Guided MRI Analysis for Assessing Clinical Progression of Cognitive Impairment with Structural MRI,"to provide accurate brain anatomy, we perform image preprocessing and
brain tissue segmentation for these mris to generate ground-truth segmentation
of three tissues, i.e., white matter (wm), gray matter (gm) and cerebrospinal
fluid (csf), using an in-house toolbox ibeat [16] with manual verification.the
downstream model is trained on 1) a late-life depression (lld) study with 309
subjects from two sites [17,18], and 2) a type 2 diabetes mellitus (dm) study
with 82 subjects from the first affiliated hospital of guangzhou university of
chinese medicine."
