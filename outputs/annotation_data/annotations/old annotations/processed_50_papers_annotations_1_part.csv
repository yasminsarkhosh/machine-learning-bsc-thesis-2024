The collection process can be found in supplementary materials.To handle the imbalance of dataset, we randomly select 586 lesions as the training and validation set with no more than 700 axial slices in each lesion type, and the rest 175 lesions constitute the test set. Lesions from the same patient are either assigned to the training and validation set or the test set, but not both.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Abdominal,Radiology,Limited Use of Demographic Data
36,Uncertainty-Informed Mutual Learning for Joint Medical Image Classification and Segmentation,"we evaluate the our uml network on two datasetsrefuge [14] and ispy-1 [13]. refuge contains two tasks, classification ofglaucoma and segmentation of optic disc/cup in fundus images. the overall 1200images were equally divided for training, validation, and testing. all imagesare uniformly adjusted to 256 × 256 px. the tasks of ispy-1 are the pcrprediction and the breast tumor segmentation. a total of 157 patients who sufferthe breast cancer are considered -43 achieve pcr and 114 non-pcr.for each case,we cut out the slices in the 3d image and totally got 1,570 2d images, which arerandomly divided into the train, validation, and test datasets with 1,230, 170,and 170 slices, respectively",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Skin and Breast,"Miscellaneous, Imaging Processing and Analysis",No Demographic Data
37,Unpaired Cross-Modal Interaction Learning for COVID-19 Segmentation on Limited CT Images,"We used the public COVID-19 segmentation benchmark [15] to verify the proposed UCI. It is collected from two public resources [5,8] on chest CT images available on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) [4]. All CT images wereacquired without intravenous contrast enhancement from patients with positive Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for SARSCoV-2. In total, we used 199 CT images including 149 training images and 50 test images. We also used two chest x-ray-based classification datasets including ChestX-ray14 [18] and ChestXR [1] to assist the UCI training. The ChestXray14 dataset comprises 112,120 X-ray images showing positive cases from 30,805 patients, encompassing 14 disease image labels pertaining to thoracic and lung ailments. An image may contain multiple or no labels. The ChestXR dataset consists of 21,390 samples, with each sample classified as healthy, pneumonia, or COVID-19.",3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Thoracic/Chest,Radiology,No Demographic Data
38,X2Vision: 3D CT Reconstruction from Biplanar X-Rays with Deep Structure Prior,"we trained our model with a large dataset of 3500 cts of patients with head-and-neck cancer, more exactly 2297 patients from the publicly available the cancer imaging archive (tcia)
for reference, compared to 3dstylegan [10], our model achieved half their fid score on another brain mri dataset, with comparable ms-ssim. this approach may provide coarse reconstructions for patients with rare abnormalities, as most learning methods, but a larger dataset or developing a prior including tissue abnormalities could improve robustness",2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Cranial/Head and Neck,Radiology,No Demographic Data
