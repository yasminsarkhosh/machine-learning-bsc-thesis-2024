Abstract.
 The utility of machine learning models in histopathology
image analysis for disease diagnosis has been extensively studied. How-
ever, efforts to stratify patient risk are relatively under-explored. While
most current techniques utilize small fields of view (so-called local fea-
tures) to link histopathology images to patient outcome, in this work we
investigate the combination of global (i.e., contextual) and local features
in a graph-based neural network for patient risk stratification. The pro-
posed network not only combines both fine and coarse histological pat-
terns but also utilizes their interactions for improved risk stratification.
We compared the performance of our proposed model against the state-
of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in histopathology risk stratification in two
cancer datasets. Our results suggest that the proposed model is capable
of stratifying patients into statistically significant risk groups (
p <

to achieve a statistical significance endpoint (

Introduction,"The examination of tissue and cells using microscope (referred to as histology)
has been a key component of cancer diagnosis and prognostication since more
than a hundred years ago. Histological features allow visual readout of cancer
biology as they represent the overall impact of genetic changes on cells [
20
].
The great rise of deep learning in the past decade and our ability to digitize
histopathology slides using high-throughput slide scanners have fueled inter-
ests in the applications of deep learning in histopathology image analysis. The

majority of the efforts, so far, focus on the deployment of these models for diag-
nosis and classification [
27
]. As such, there is a paucity of efforts that embark
on utilizing machine learning models for patient prognostication and survival
analysis (for example, predicting risk of cancer recurrence or expected patient
survival). While prognostication and survival analysis offer invaluable insights
for patient management, biological studies and drug development efforts, they
require careful tracking of patients for a lengthy period of time; rendering this
as a task that requires a significant amount of effort and funding.
In the machine learning domain, patient prognostication can be treated as a
weakly supervised problem, which a model would predict the outcome (e.g., time
to cancer recurrence) based on the histopathology images. Their majority have
utilized Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) [
8
] that is a two-step learning method.
First, representation maps for a set of patches (i.e., small fields of view), called
a bag of instances, are extracted. Then, a second pooling model is applied to the
feature maps for the final prediction. Different MIL variations have shown supe-
rior performances in grading or subtype classification in comparison to outcome
prediction [
10
]. This is perhaps due to the fact that MIL-based technique do
not incorporate patch locations and interactions as well as tissue heterogeneity
which can potentially have a vital role in defining clinical outcomes [
4
,
26
].
To address this issue, graph neural networks (GNN) have recently received
more attention in histology. They can model patch relations [
17
] by utilizing mes-
sage passing mechanism via edges connecting the nodes (i.e., small patches in our
case). However, most GNN-based models suffer from over smoothing [
22
] which
limits nodes' receptive fields [
3
]. While local contexts mainly capture cell-cell
interactions, global patterns such as immune cell infiltration patterns and tumor
invasion in normal tissue structures (e.g., depth of invasion through myometrium
in endometrial cancer [
1
]) could capture critical information about outcome [
10
].
Hence, locally focused methods are unable to benefit from the coarse properties
of slides due to their high dimensions which may lead to poor performance.
This paper aims to investigate the potential of extracting fine and coarse
features from histopathology slides and integrating them for risk stratification
in cancer patients. Therefore, the contributions of this work can be summarized
as: 1) a novel graph-based model for predicting survival that extracts both local
and global properties by identifying morphological super-nodes; 2) introducing
a fine-coarse feature distillation module with 3 various strategies to aggregate
interactions at different scales; 3) outperforming SOTA approaches in both risk
prediction and patient stratification scenarios on two datasets; 4) publishing
two large and rare prostate cancer datasets containing more than 220 graphs for
active surveillance and 240 graphs for brachytherapy cases. The code and graph
embeddings are publicly available at

of powerful deep discriminative models in the recent years [

Survival Analysis and GNNs in Histopathology
MIL-based models have been utilized for outcome prediction [
29

32

also be integrated with attention-based variants [
14
]. GNNs due to their struc-
tural preserving capacity [
28
] have drawn attention in various histology domains
by constructing the graph on cells or patches. However, current GNN-based risk
assessment variants are only focused on short-range interactions [
16
,
17
] or con-
sider local contexts [
10
]. We hypothesize that graph-based models' performance
in survival prediction improves by leveraging both fine and coarse properties."

domain resulting in an adjacency matrix"

Self-supervised Encoder
Due to computational limits and large number of patches available for each
patient, we utilize a self-supervised approach to train an encoder to reduce
the inputs' feature space size. Therefore, We use DINO [

], a knowledge dis-
tillation model (KDM), with vision transformer (ViT) [

utilizes global and local augmentations of the input

 The overview of our proposed method. a) The input slide is tiled into non-
overlapping patches. b) The patches are fed into a self-supervised encoder to extract
embeddings. c) A graph is constructed and the new local instance-level embeddings
are obtained through the message-passing process. d) The global context representa-
tions in the form of super-nodes are extracted utilizing two unsupervised loss functions
(
R
minCUT
 ,
 R
orthognal
). e) The fine and coarse feature vectors are aggregated in the
distillation module to obtain a representation that accounts for both local and global
(contextual) histo-morphological features. Three different strategies (S1, S2, S3) are
explored in this module. Finally, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is deployed to esti-
mate the risk using final resultant vectors.
representations without any labels. Then, by using distillation loss, it makes the
representations' distribution similar to each other. Finally, the fixed weights of
the teacher model are utilized in order to encode the input patches.
3.3
Local Graph Neural Network
GNN's objective is to find new nodes' embeddings via integrating local neighbors'
interactions with individual properties of patches. By exploiting the message
passing mechanism, this module iteratively aggregates features from neighbors
of each vertex and generates the new node representations. We employ two graph
convolution isomorphism operators (GINconv) [
30
] with the generalized form as:"
X,"'
n
=

Super-Nodes Extractor
In order to find the coarse histo-morphological patterns disguised in the local
graph, we propose extracting"
 K," Super-nodes, which each represents a weighted
cluster of further processed local features. Intuitively, the number of super-nodes
K should not be very large or small, as the former encourages them to only
represent local clusters and the latter leads to larger clusters and loses subtle

details. We exploit the minCUT [
5
] idea to extract super-nodes in a differentiable
process after an auxiliary GINconv to focus more on large-scale interactions and
to finally learn the most global correlated super-nodes. Inspired by the relaxation
form of the known K-way minCUT problem, we create a continuous cluster
matrix"

using MLP layers and can finally estimate the super-nodes

dent on the final survival-specific loss. In addition, two additional unsupervised
weighted regularization terms are optimized to improve the process:
MinCut Regularizer.
 This term is motivated by the original minCUT problem
and intends to solve it for the the patients' graph. It is defined as:"

Orthogonality Regularizer."
 R,"minCUT
 is non-convex and potent to local min-
ima such as assigning all vertexes to a super-node or having multiple super-nodes
with only a single vertex."
 R,"orthogonal
 penalizes such solutions and helps the model
to distribute the graph's features between super-nodes. It can be formulated as:"

F
 is the Frobenius norm, and"
 I," is the identity matrix. This term pushes
the model's parameters to find coarse features that are orthogonal to each other
resulting in having the most useful global features.
Overall, utilizing these two terms encourages the model to extract super-
nodes by leaning more towards the strongly associated vertexes and keeping
them against weakly connected ones [
5
], while the main survival loss still controls
the global extraction process.

Experiments and Results,"4.1
Dataset
We utilize two prostate cancer (PCa) datasets to evaluate the performance of
our proposed model. The first set (PCa-AS) includes 179 PCa patients who
were managed with Active Surveillance (AS). Radical therapy is considered
overtreatment in these patients, so they are instead monitored with regular
serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements, physical examinations,
sequential biopsies, and magnetic resonance imaging [
23
]. However, AS may be
over- or under-utilized in low- and intermediate-risk PCa due to the uncertainty
of current methods to distinguish indolent from aggressive cancers [
11
]. Although
majority of patients in our cohort are classified as low-risk based on NCCN guide-
lines [
21
], a significant subset of them experienced disease upgrade that triggered
definitive therapy (range: 6.2 to 224 months after diagnosis).
The second dataset (PCa-BT) includes 105 PCa patients with low to high
risk disease who went through brachytherapy. This treatment involves placing a
radioactive material inside the body to safely deliver larger dose of radiation at

time to recurrence ranging from 11.7 to 56.1 months.
We also utilized the Prostate cANcer graDe Assessment (PANDA) Challenge
dataset [
7
] that includes more than 10,000 PCa needle biopsy slides (no outcome
data) as an external dataset for training the encoder of our model.
4.2
Experiments
We evaluate the models' performance in two scenarios utilizing several objective
metrics. Implementation details are available in supplementary material.
Hazard (Risk) Prediction.
 We utilize concordance-index (c-index) that mea-
sures the relative ordering of patients with observed events and un-censored
cases relative to censored instances [
2
]. Using c-index, we compare the quality
of hazard ranking against multiple methods including two MIL (DeepSet [
31
],"
AMIL [,"14
]) and graph-based (DGC [
17
] and Patch-GCN [
10
]) models that were
utilized recently for histopathology risk assessment. C-index values are avail-
able in Table
 1
. The proposed model with all strategies outperforms baselines
across all sets and is able to achieve 0.639 and 0.600 on PCa-AS and PCa-BT,
while the baselines, at best, obtain 0.555, and 0.572, respectively. Statistical tests
(paired t-test) on c-indices also show that our model is statistically better than
all baselines in PCa-AS and also superior to all models, except DGC, in PCa-BT.
Superior performance of our MCA policy implies that balanced exploitation of
fine and coarse features with shared weights may provide more robust contex-
tual information compared to using mixed guided information or utilizing them
independently.
Patient Stratification.
 The capacity of stratifying patients into risk groups
(e.g., low and high risk) is another criterion that we employ to assess the util-
ity of models in clinical practice. We evaluate model performances via Kaplan-
Meier curve [
15
] (cut-off set as the ratio of patients with recurrence within 3
772

years of therapy initiation for PCa-BT and the ratio of upgraded cases for PCa-
AS), LogRank test [
6
] (with 0.05 as significance level), and median outcome
associated with risk groups (Table
 1
 and Fig.
 2
). Our model stratified PCa-AS
patients into high- and low-risk groups with median time to progression of 36.5
and 131.7 months, respectively. Moreover, PCa-BT cases assigned to high- and
low-risk groups have median recurrence time of 21.86 and 35.7 months. While
none of the baselines are capable of assigning patients into risk groups with
statistical significance, our distillation policies achieve significant separation in
both PCa-AS and PCa-BT datasets; suggesting that global histo-morphological
properties improve patient stratification performance. Furthermore, our findings
have significant clinical implications as they identify, for the first time, high-
risk prostate cancer patients who are otherwise known to be low-risk based on
clinico-pathological parameters. This group should be managed differently from
the rest of the low-risk prostate cancer patients in the clinic. Therefore, pro-
viding evidence of the predictive (as opposed to prognostic) clinical information
that our model provides. While a prognostic biomarker provides information
about a patient's outcome (without specific recommendation on the next course
of action), a predictive biomarker gives insights about the effect of a therapeutic
intervention and potential actions that can be taken.
Ablation Study.
 We perform ablation study (Table
 2
) on various components
of our framework including local nodes, self-supervised ViT-based encoder, and
most importantly, super-nodes in addition to fine-coarse distillation module.
Although our local-only model is still showing superior results compared to
baselines, this analysis demonstrates that all modules are essential for learn-
ing the most effective representations. We also assess the impact of our ViT on
the baselines (full-results in appendix), showing that it can, on average, improve
their performance by an increase of
 ~
 0
.
03 in c-index for PCa-AS. However, the
best baseline with ViT still has poorer performance compared to our model in
both datasets, while the number of parameters (reported for ViT embeddings'
size in Table
 1
) in our full-model is about half of this baseline. Achieving higher
c-indices in our all model versions indicates the important role of coarse features
and global context in patient risk estimation in addition to local patterns.

Conclusion,"While risk assessment is relatively under-explored, most existing methods are
focused only on small fields of view. In this work, we introduce a novel graph-
based model for integrating global and local features, which utilizes interactions
at a larger scale for improved risk stratification. Using two cancer datasets, we
evaluated the effectiveness of our model against the baseline methods for hazard
prediction and patients stratification. Our results suggest that the proposed
model outperforms them in risk assessment and is capable of separating patients
into statistically significant risk groups with actionable clinical utility. The full
capacity of this work can be revealed by extending it to other histology tasks.
