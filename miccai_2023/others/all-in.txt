The utility of machine learning models in histopathology image analysis for disease diagnosis has been extensively studied. How- ever, eﬀorts to stratify patient risk are relatively under-explored. While most current techniques utilize small ﬁelds of view (so-called local fea- tures) to link histopathology images to patient outcome, in this work we investigate the combination of global (i.e., contextual) and local features in a graph-based neural network for patient risk stratiﬁcation. The pro- posed network not only combines both ﬁne and coarse histological pat- terns but also utilizes their interactions for improved risk stratiﬁcation. We compared the performance of our proposed model against the state- of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in histopathology risk stratiﬁcation in two cancer datasets. Our results suggest that the proposed model is capable of stratifying patients into statistically signiﬁcant risk groups (p < 0.01 across the two datasets) with clinical utility while competing models fail to achieve a statistical signiﬁcance endpoint (p = 0.148 − 0.494).Keywords: Histopathology · Risk Assessment · Graph Processing1 IntroductionThe examination of tissue and cells using microscope (referred to as histology) has been a key component of cancer diagnosis and prognostication since more than a hundred years ago. Histological features allow visual readout of cancer biology as they represent the overall impact of genetic changes on cells [20].   The great rise of deep learning in the past decade and our ability to digitize histopathology slides using high-throughput slide scanners have fueled inter- ests in the applications of deep learning in histopathology image analysis.

majority of the eﬀorts, so far, focus on the deployment of these models for diag- nosis and classiﬁcation [27]. As such, there is a paucity of eﬀorts that embark on utilizing machine learning models for patient prognostication and survival analysis (for example, predicting risk of cancer recurrence or expected patient survival). While prognostication and survival analysis oﬀer invaluable insights for patient management, biological studies and drug development eﬀorts, they require careful tracking of patients for a lengthy period of time; rendering this as a task that requires a signiﬁcant amount of eﬀort and funding.   In the machine learning domain, patient prognostication can be treated as a weakly supervised problem, which a model would predict the outcome (e.g., time to cancer recurrence) based on the histopathology images. Their majority have utilized Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) [8] that is a two-step learning method. First, representation maps for a set of patches (i.e., small ﬁelds of view), called a bag of instances, are extracted. Then, a second pooling model is applied to the feature maps for the ﬁnal prediction. Diﬀerent MIL variations have shown supe- rior performances in grading or subtype classiﬁcation in comparison to outcome prediction [10]. This is perhaps due to the fact that MIL-based technique do not incorporate patch locations and interactions as well as tissue heterogeneity which can potentially have a vital role in deﬁning clinical outcomes [4, 26].   To address this issue, graph neural networks (GNN) have recently received more attention in histology. They can model patch relations [17] by utilizing mes- sage passing mechanism via edges connecting the nodes (i.e., small patches in our case). However, most GNN-based models suﬀer from over smoothing [22] which limits nodes’ receptive ﬁelds [3]. While local contexts mainly capture cell-cell interactions, global patterns such as immune cell inﬁltration patterns and tumor invasion in normal tissue structures (e.g., depth of invasion through myometrium in endometrial cancer [1]) could capture critical information about outcome [10]. Hence, locally focused methods are unable to beneﬁt from the coarse properties of slides due to their high dimensions which may lead to poor performance.   This paper aims to investigate the potential of extracting ﬁne and coarse features from histopathology slides and integrating them for risk stratiﬁcation in cancer patients. Therefore, the contributions of this work can be summarized as: 1) a novel graph-based model for predicting survival that extracts both local and global properties by identifying morphological super-nodes; 2) introducing a ﬁne-coarse feature distillation module with 3 various strategies to aggregate interactions at diﬀerent scales; 3) outperforming SOTA approaches in both risk prediction and patient stratiﬁcation scenarios on two datasets; 4) publishing two large and rare prostate cancer datasets containing more than 220 graphs for active surveillance and 240 graphs for brachytherapy cases. The code and graph embeddings are publicly available at https://github.com/pazadimo/ALL-IN2 Related Works2.1 Weakly Supervised Learning in HistopathologyUtilizing Weakly Supervised Learning for modeling histopathology problems has been getting popular due to the high resolution of slides and substantial time
and ﬁnancial costs associated with annotating them as well as the development of powerful deep discriminative models in the recent years [24].   Such models are used to perform nuclei segmentation [18], identify novel subtypes [12], or later descendants are even able to pinpoint sub-areas with a high diagnostic value [19].2.2 Survival Analysis and GNNs in HistopathologyMIL-based models have been utilized for outcome prediction [29, 32] which can also be integrated with attention-based variants [14]. GNNs due to their struc- tural preserving capacity [28] have drawn attention in various histology domains by constructing the graph on cells or patches. However, current GNN-based risk assessment variants are only focused on short-range interactions [16, 17] or con- sider local contexts [10]. We hypothesize that graph-based models’ performance in survival prediction improves by leveraging both ﬁne and coarse properties.3 MethodFigure 1 summarizes our proposed end-to-end solution. Below, we have provided details of each module.3.1 Problem FormulationFor Pn, which is the n-th patient, a set of patches {patchj}M	is extractedfrom the related whole slide images. In addition, a latent vector zj R1×d is extracted from patchj using our encoder network (described in Sect. 3.2) that results in feature matrix Zn RM×d for Pn. Finally, a speciﬁc graph (Gn) for the n-th patient (Pn) can be constructed by assuming patches as nodes. Also, edges are connected based on the patches’ k-nearest neighbour in the spatial domain resulting in an adjacency matrix An. Therefore, for each patient such as Pn, we have a graph deﬁned by adjacency matrix An with size M M and features matrix Zn (Gn = graph(Zn, An)). We estimate K super-nodes as matrix Sn RK×d representing groups of local nodes with similar properties as coarse features for Pn’s slides. The ﬁnal model (cθ) with parameters θ utilizes Gn and Sn to predict the risk associated with this patient:riskn = cθ(Gn, Sn) = cθ(graph(Xn, An), Sn)	(1)3.2 Self-supervised EncoderDue to computational limits and large number of patches available for each patient, we utilize a self-supervised approach to train an encoder to reduce the inputs’ feature space size. Therefore, We use DINO [9], a knowledge dis- tillation model (KDM), with vision transformer (ViT) [13] as the backbone. It utilizes global and local augmentations of the input patchj and passes them to the student (Sθ1,V iT ) and teacher (Tθ2,V iT ) models to ﬁnd their respective
Fig. 1. The overview of our proposed method. a) The input slide is tiled into non- overlapping patches. b) The patches are fed into a self-supervised encoder to extract embeddings. c) A graph is constructed and the new local instance-level embeddings are obtained through the message-passing process. d) The global context representa- tions in the form of super-nodes are extracted utilizing two unsupervised loss functions (RminCUT , Rorthognal). e) The ﬁne and coarse feature vectors are aggregated in the distillation module to obtain a representation that accounts for both local and global (contextual) histo-morphological features. Three diﬀerent strategies (S1, S2, S3) are explored in this module. Finally, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is deployed to esti- mate the risk using ﬁnal resultant vectors.representations without any labels. Then, by using distillation loss, it makes the representations’ distribution similar to each other. Finally, the ﬁxed weights of the teacher model are utilized in order to encode the input patches.3.3 Local Graph Neural NetworkGNN’s objective is to ﬁnd new nodes’ embeddings via integrating local neighbors’ interactions with individual properties of patches. By exploiting the message passing mechanism, this module iteratively aggregates features from neighbors of each vertex and generates the new node representations. We employ two graph convolution isomorphism operators (GINconv) [30] with the generalized form as:1 = φ (An + (1+ c).I).Xn) ,	(2)where c is a small positive value and I is the identity matrix. Also, φ denotes theweights of two MLP layers. Xn ∈ RM×d and X1 ∈ RM×d are GINconv’s inputand output feature matrices for Pn, which Xn equals Zn for the ﬁrst layer.3.4 Super-Nodes ExtractorIn order to ﬁnd the coarse histo-morphological patterns disguised in the local graph, we propose extracting K Super-nodes, which each represents a weighted cluster of further processed local features. Intuitively, the number of super-nodes K should not be very large or small, as the former encourages them to only represent local clusters and the latter leads to larger clusters and loses subtle
details. We exploit the minCUT [5] idea to extract super-nodes in a diﬀerentiable process after an auxiliary GINconv to focus more on large-scale interactions and to ﬁnally learn the most global correlated super-nodes. Inspired by the relaxation form of the known K-way minCUT problem, we create a continuous cluster matrix Cn ∈ RM×K using MLP layers and can ﬁnally estimate the super-nodes features (Sn ∈ RM×d) as:Sn = CT .X1 ,  Cn = softmax (ReLU (X1 .W1).W2) ,	(3)n	n	nwhere W1, W2 are MLPs’ weights. Hence, the extracted nodes are directly depen- dent on the ﬁnal survival-speciﬁc loss. In addition, two additional unsupervised weighted regularization terms are optimized to improve the process:MinCut Regularizer. This term is motivated by the original minCUT problem and intends to solve it for the the patients’ graph. It is deﬁned as:Tr(CT .An,norm.Cn)
RminCUT = −
nTr(CT .Dn.Cn)
,	(4)
where Dn is the diagonal degree matrix for An. Also, Tr(.) represents the trace of matrix and An,norm is the normalized adjacency matrix. RminCUT ’s mini- mum value happens when Tr(CT .An,norm.Cn) equals Tr(CT .Dg,n.Cn). There-n	nfore, minimizing RminCUT causes assigning strongly similar nodes to a same super-node and prevent their association with others.Orthogonality Regularizer. RminCUT is non-convex and potent to local min- ima such as assigning all vertexes to a super-node or having multiple super-nodes with only a single vertex. Rorthogonal penalizes such solutions and helps the model to distribute the graph’s features between super-nodes. It can be formulated as:
\\	CT .Cn
I  \\
Rorthogonal = \\
n||CT .Cn||F
− √  \\
,	(5)
where . F is the Frobenius norm, and I is the identity matrix. This term pushes the model’s parameters to ﬁnd coarse features that are orthogonal to each other resulting in having the most useful global features.   Overall, utilizing these two terms encourages the model to extract super- nodes by leaning more towards the strongly associated vertexes and keeping them against weakly connected ones [5], while the main survival loss still controls the global extraction process.3.5 Fine-Coarse DistillationWe propose our ﬁne-coarse morphological feature distillation module to leverage all-scale interactions in the ﬁnal prediction by ﬁnding a local and a global patient-level representations (hˆl,n, hˆg,n). Assume that X1 ∈ RM×d and Sn ∈ RK×d arethe feature matrices taken from local GNN (Sect. 3.3) and super-nodes for Pn, respectively. We explore 3 diﬀerent attention-based feature distillation strategies for this task, including:
– Dual Attention (DA): Two gated self-attention modules for local and global properties with separate weights (Wφ,l, Wφ,g, Wk,l, Wk,g, Wq,l, Wq,g) are utilized to ﬁnd patches scores αl R1×M and αg R1×K and the ﬁnal features (hˆl,n, hˆg,n ) as:	r	(	I	I  )l
i=1 
n,i
n	n(6)r	(	)l
i=1
n	n(7)
where x1	and sn,i are rows of X1 and Sn, respectively, and the ﬁnal repre-sentation (hˆ) is generated as hˆ = cat(hˆl, hˆg ).ñ Mixed Guided Attention (MGA): In the ﬁrst strategy, the information ﬂows from local and global features to the ﬁnal representations in paral- lel without mixing any knowledge. The purpose of this policy is the heavy fusion of ﬁne and coarse knowledge by exploiting shared weights (Wφ,shared, Wk,shared, Wq,shared, Wv,shared) in both routes and beneﬁting from the guid- ance of local representation on learning the global one by modifying Eq. (7)ñ 
to:
r	(	T ˆ
T ˆ	)l
ñ Mixed Co-Attention (MCA): While the ﬁrst strategy allows the extreme separation of two paths, the second one has the highest level of mixing infor- mation. Here, we take a balanced policy between the independence and knowl- edge mixture of the two routes by only sharing the weights without using any guidance.4 Experiments and Results4.1 DatasetWe utilize two prostate cancer (PCa) datasets to evaluate the performance of our proposed model. The ﬁrst set (PCa-AS) includes 179 PCa patients who were managed with Active Surveillance (AS). Radical therapy is considered overtreatment in these patients, so they are instead monitored with regular serum prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) measurements, physical examinations, sequential biopsies, and magnetic resonance imaging [23]. However, AS may be over- or under-utilized in low- and intermediate-risk PCa due to the uncertainty of current methods to distinguish indolent from aggressive cancers [11]. Although majority of patients in our cohort are classiﬁed as low-risk based on NCCN guide- lines [21], a signiﬁcant subset of them experienced disease upgrade that triggered deﬁnitive therapy (range: 6.2 to 224 months after diagnosis).   The second dataset (PCa-BT) includes 105 PCa patients with low to high risk disease who went through brachytherapy. This treatment involves placing a radioactive material inside the body to safely deliver larger dose of radiation at

The recorded endpoint for this set is biochemical recurrence with time to recurrence ranging from 11.7 to 56.1 months.   We also utilized the Prostate cANcer graDe Assessment (PANDA) Challenge dataset [7] that includes more than 10,000 PCa needle biopsy slides (no outcome data) as an external dataset for training the encoder of our model.4.2 ExperimentsWe evaluate the models’ performance in two scenarios utilizing several objective metrics. Implementation details are available in supplementary material.Hazard (Risk) Prediction. We utilize concordance-index (c-index) that mea- sures the relative ordering of patients with observed events and un-censored cases relative to censored instances [2]. Using c-index, we compare the quality of hazard ranking against multiple methods including two MIL (DeepSet [31], AMIL [14]) and graph-based (DGC [17] and Patch-GCN [10]) models that were utilized recently for histopathology risk assessment. C-index values are avail- able in Table 1. The proposed model with all strategies outperforms baselines across all sets and is able to achieve 0.639 and 0.600 on PCa-AS and PCa-BT, while the baselines, at best, obtain 0.555, and 0.572, respectively. Statistical tests (paired t-test) on c-indices also show that our model is statistically better than all baselines in PCa-AS and also superior to all models, except DGC, in PCa-BT. Superior performance of our MCA policy implies that balanced exploitation of ﬁne and coarse features with shared weights may provide more robust contex- tual information compared to using mixed guided information or utilizing them independently.Patient Stratification. The capacity of stratifying patients into risk groups (e.g., low and high risk) is another criterion that we employ to assess the util- ity of models in clinical practice. We evaluate model performances via Kaplan- Meier curve [15] (cut-oﬀ set as the ratio of patients with recurrence within 3
Fig. 2. Kaplan-Meier curves of mixed co-attention model for PCa-AS and PCa-BT.years of therapy initiation for PCa-BT and the ratio of upgraded cases for PCa- AS), LogRank test [6] (with 0.05 as signiﬁcance level), and median outcome associated with risk groups (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Our model stratiﬁed PCa-AS patients into high- and low-risk groups with median time to progression of 36.5 and 131.7 months, respectively. Moreover, PCa-BT cases assigned to high- and low-risk groups have median recurrence time of 21.86 and 35.7 months. While none of the baselines are capable of assigning patients into risk groups with statistical signiﬁcance, our distillation policies achieve signiﬁcant separation in both PCa-AS and PCa-BT datasets; suggesting that global histo-morphological properties improve patient stratiﬁcation performance. Furthermore, our ﬁndings have signiﬁcant clinical implications as they identify, for the ﬁrst time, high- risk prostate cancer patients who are otherwise known to be low-risk based on clinico-pathological parameters. This group should be managed diﬀerently from the rest of the low-risk prostate cancer patients in the clinic. Therefore, pro- viding evidence of the predictive (as opposed to prognostic) clinical information that our model provides. While a prognostic biomarker provides information about a patient’s outcome (without speciﬁc recommendation on the next course of action), a predictive biomarker gives insights about the eﬀect of a therapeutic intervention and potential actions that can be taken.Ablation Study. We perform ablation study (Table 2) on various components of our framework including local nodes, self-supervised ViT-based encoder, and most importantly, super-nodes in addition to ﬁne-coarse distillation module. Although our local-only model is still showing superior results compared to baselines, this analysis demonstrates that all modules are essential for learn- ing the most eﬀective representations. We also assess the impact of our ViT on the baselines (full-results in appendix), showing that it can, on average, improve their performance by an increase of 0.03 in c-index for PCa-AS. However, the best baseline with ViT still has poorer performance compared to our model in both datasets, while the number of parameters (reported for ViT embeddings’ size in Table 1) in our full-model is about half of this baseline. Achieving higher c-indices in our all model versions indicates the important role of coarse features and global context in patient risk estimation in addition to local patterns.

In this work, we introduce a novel graph- based model for integrating global and local features, which utilizes interactions at a larger scale for improved risk stratiﬁcation. Using two cancer datasets, we evaluated the eﬀectiveness of our model against the baseline methods for hazard prediction and patients stratiﬁcation. Our results suggest that the proposed model outperforms them in risk assessment and is capable of separating patients into statistically signiﬁcant risk groups with actionable clinical utility. The full capacity of this work can be revealed by extending it to other histology tasks.Acknowledgment:.
