<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The conventional histopathology paradigm can provide the gold standard for clinical diagnosis, which, however, suffers from lengthy processing time and requires costly laboratory equipment. Recent advancements made in deep learning for computational histopathology have sparked lots of efforts in achieving a rapid chemical-free staining technique. Yet, existing approaches are limited to well-prepared thin sections, and invalid in handling more than one stain. In this paper, we present a multiple histological staining model for thick tissues (Mul-HiST), without any laborious sample preparation, sectioning, and staining process. We use the grey-scale light-sheet microscopy image of thick tissues as model input and transfer it into different histologically stained versions, including hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), Masson's trichrome (MT), and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). This is the first work that enables the automatic and simultaneous generation of multiple histological staining for thick biological samples. Moreover, we empirically demonstrate that the AdaIN-based generator offers an advantage over other configurations to achieve higher-quality multi-style image generation. Extensive experiments also indicated that multi-domain data fusion is conducive to the model capturing shared pathological features. We believe that the proposed MulHiST can potentially be applied in clinical rapid pathology and will significantly improve the current histological workflow.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Histological staining is regarded as the standard protocol in clinical pathological examination, which is used to label biological structures and morphological changes in tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The most frequently used histological staining is H&amp;E stain for the inspection of cell nuclei and the extracellular matrix, in addition to some special stains to complement specific biomarkers and particular structures, such as MT stain used for connective tissues and PAS stain used for mucopolysaccharides <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, multiple tissue sections are required if special stains are desired since the same section cannot be stained several times in conventional pathology workflow. In general, pathologists need to check the H&amp;E-stained images firstly for a basic examination, and then decide whether to prepare additional sections and perform special stains, which will increase the time for diagnosis. More importantly, the abovementioned traditional histochemical staining techniques can only be performed on thin sections of 2-10 µm. Therefore, sample preparation steps, including paraffin embedding, tissue slicing, and chemical dewaxing, will result in long turnaround times and high laboratory infrastructure demands.</p><p>The rapidly emerging field of digital virtual staining has shown great promise to revolutionize the decade-old staining workflow. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> have done pioneering works on multi-stain translation from unstained thin sections, and Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> also tried to achieve multiple stains generation from label-free tissue images. Both used an image registration to prepare pixel-level matched source-unstained and target-stained image pairs for supervised model training. However, obtaining such pixel-wise aligned data is not accessible for thick tissues as the traditional histological staining can only be performed on thin sections. Even though we can collect the surface cut from the thick specimen and then stain it with chemical reagents, there is still a huge morphological difference due to multiple-layer information captured by a slide-free microscope. Therefore, the virtual staining of thick tissues has to rely on unsupervised methods. There were some primary investigations on virtual staining of thick tissues that use slide-free imaging systems, such as MUSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, CHAMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and UV-PAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, those methods can only produce virtual H&amp;E-stained images instead of multi-stained images. The emergency of starGAN opens new possibilities for multi-domain image translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and they achieve flexible facial attribute transfer with the proposed domain label. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> employ the idea of the domain label to represent different staining for multiple histological staining generations. However, those models use H&amp;E staining as input and transfer H&amp;E staining into other stains, which still require laborious tissue embedding and slide sectioning process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> focus on the unsupervised multiple virtual staining from autofluorescence images, yet the input should be images obtained from thin slides, which is not ideal for thick tissues.</p><p>In this paper, we propose MulHiST, a novel Multiple Histological Staining model for Thick biological tissues, which is not feasible in the traditional histochemical staining workflow. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to achieve multiple histological staining generations for thick tissues. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . Our key contributions are: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> we propose MulHiST: a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based multi-domain image translation model capable of mapping a given light-sheet (LS) image of thick tissue into its histologically stained (HS) versions. We utilize unsupervised learning and do not require paired images, tailored for the virtual staining from slide-free imaging techniques; (2) we verify that the multi-domain translation can capture more reliable histopathological features for generating high-quality images, eliminating the ambiguity brought by multiple layers of information in thick tissue images; (3) both qualitative and quantitative results on H&amp;E/PAS/MT staining generations show the superiority and efficiency of the proposed MulHiST over other baseline models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methodology</head><p>To represent different staining types, we follow the idea of the domain-specific attribute vector proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, aiming to use a one-hot vector c to indicate unstained and various stained domains. During the training, the generator aims to transfer the image style of input image x to the desired domain c while keeping the content of x : G (x, c) → y, which means y has the same pathological context as x but with a different image style. When the training is finished, we use the well-trained generator to achieve multiple histological stain generations.</p><p>In general, the image of thick tissues contains several-layer information, and information from different layers interferes with each other, which will lead to ambiguity in the determination of pathological features, e.g., cell boundary and tissue content. We believe that all the image domains, i.e., LS images and H&amp;E/PAS/MT-stained images, share some domain-invariant features that can facilitate the model training. Moreover, our generator learns the mapping between every two domains. Then, a reconstruction loss can be employed in the single-generator model (orange dashed arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). We only need to input the LS image for the inference to get its corresponding histological stained versions (right part in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Unlike starGAN, we add the style code into the model with the Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) Layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> instead of concatenating the style code with the input image along the channel dimension. We only add the AdaIN to the decoder module, which will not affect the image feature extraction and encoding of the model input. The parameters of AdaIN are dynamically generated by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) based on the style code. The discriminator used in this work follows the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, providing adversarial feedback to guide the learning of the generator. However, our discriminator will further classify images into different domains, not limited to real or fake signals.</p><p>During the training, we incorporate multiple domain images and shuffle the ensembled dataset. A style code c can be generated randomly to indicate the target domain for the generator. The generator will transfer the input image into an image with the target style indicated by c, and the semantic content of the original input will not change. The model forward can be expressed by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">G(x, c) = Dec(R(Enc(x)), MLP (c)) (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where c is the style code that is randomly generated during the training. R is residual block. Enc and Dec are the encoder and decoder in the generator, respectively. The AdaIN layer in the decoder can be computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">AdaIN (x, s) = σ(s) x -μ(x) σ(x) + μ(s) (2)</formula><p>where x here is the feature map results of the previous layer, and s is the output of MLP. AdaIN aims to align the mean and variance of the input to match those of the desired style. The overall loss formulation of the generator is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L G = λ 1 L G adv + λ 2 L rec (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">L rec = x -G(G(x, c trg ), c org )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where the L G adv is the adversarial loss and L rec is the image reconstruction loss. The c trg is the generated target style code and c org is the style code of the original input images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experimental Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Dataset and Implementation Details</head><p>In this work, we prepared six thick tissue slabs and obtained scanned images of ∼15,000 × 15,000 pixels using an open-top LS microscope with an excitation wavelength of 266 nm. After imaging, the specimens were sectioned and histologically processed with the standard protocol to obtain HS images for the model training. We chose one set of scanned images as training data, and the others were used for the testing. For the training, we extracted small image patches with the size of 128 × 128 randomly. During testing, we divided the tested whole-slide image into 256 × 256 patches with 16 pixels overlap to avoid artifacts. There are 11,643 extracted image patches in the testing set.</p><p>Our model was implemented in PyTorch on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. We trained our model with the Adam optimizer (with β 1 = 0.5 and β 2 = 0.999) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The initial learning rate was set to 1×10 -4 for both generator and discriminator with a linear decay scheduled after 50,000 iterations. The batch size was set to 16. The λ 1 in (3) was set to 5 and λ 2 was set to 10.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Evaluation Metrics</head><p>We quantitatively evaluate our model and results with Kernel Inception Distance (KID) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which are prevalent for evaluating the quality of digitally synthesized images. Unlike natural image generation, biomedical image generation not only require these indicators that reflect the image quality but also require some more convincing metrics with clinical values. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (5 th column, cycleGAN), the image style of generated results is similar to that of the real staining. However, the MT staining generated by cycleGAN is incorrect since the background and tissue content is reversed, which means that sometimes the model can produce target images with high fidelity, but it is difficult to keep correct semantic content or targeted biomarkers. It is not easy to identify pathological features from the LS image, therefore, we need a ground truth for a more reliable comparison. However, it is infeasible to obtain the well-matched ground truth of thick tissues.</p><p>In this work, we observed that LS images of thick tissues share a similar style as fluorescence images of thin sections i.e., the cell nuclei are highlighted with positive contrast for both thin and thick tissues with the help of fluorescent labels. In this case, we used the model trained on LS images of thick tissues to test the fluorescence images of thin sections. Then, we could prepare the ground truth of thin sections for comprehensive comparison, as well as quantitative indicators, such as mean square error (MSE), structural similarity (SSIM), and peak signalto-noise ratio (PSNR). It is worth mentioning that when tested on the thinsection images, the model trained with thick-tissue images would underperform the model trained with thin-section images. Therefore, for virtual staining on thin slices, it is better to train on thin-section images as there are still some differences in details between data from thick tissues and thin sections. Here, we use the thin-section data only for model validation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Quantitative and Qualitative Results</head><p>In this paper, we select cycleGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>, MUNIT <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, and starGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> as baseline models. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, our model surpasses all comparison methods on visual results. From the virtually stained PAS (top zoomed-in regions, yellow square), we can distinguish two different convoluted tubules according to the PAS-positive/negative patterns (yellow/green arrows) in our results. In general, the glomerular and tubular basement membrane, as well as the brush border of the proximal tubules, can be visualized by the PAS staining with pink color, whereas the interior of the distal tubule will not be stained <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. There is something pink inside the tubules pointed by yellow arrows in our results and no pink area inside the tubules indicated by green arrows. However, from other model results, it is hard to recognize corresponding histopathological features. Here we train cycleGAN multiple times for every pair of source/target domains so that those three cycleGAN models are independent. For such single-domain image translation, it is hard to satisfy all domains with a correct transformation. Specifically, we can see that the H&amp;E-stained images of cycleGAN are correct, whereas the model reverses the background and cell nuclei in the MT domain. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, neither MUNIT nor starGAN can perform well in this task.</p><p>Moreover, we quantitatively evaluate the model performance with FID and KID scores, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> (top part). We can observe that our model outperforms the other baseline models significantly in three different image domains. Although the H&amp;E staining of cycleGAN also achieves good FID and KID scores, the corresponding PAS and MT staining results are much worse than ours, which also agrees with the qualitative analysis shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>As no ground truth can be provided for the virtual staining of thick tissue. We collected 2 sets of thin mouse kidney sections for the model validation. We used the model trained with LS images of thick tissues to test the scanned images of prepared thin sections. In this situation, we can perform traditional histological staining to obtain ground truth for further comparison. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> confirms that our MulHiST can generate the correct pathological features, i.e., the PAS-positive proximal convoluted tubules indicated by yellow arrows and PAS-negative distal tubules pointed by green arrows, which are consistent with the ground truth. The same pathological representation can also be observed in the PAS result of cycleGAN, whereas the MT staining generated by cycleGAN presents an obvious error between the background and tissue content. Meanwhile, the quantitative evaluation in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> (bottom part) also shows that our proposed model outperforms other baseline models in various evaluation metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Ablation Analysis</head><p>In this paper, we have two main hypotheses, one is that the model can benefit from data fusion from multiple domains due to the domain-invariant features, and the other is that the AdaIN-based style transfer is better in source image feature extraction compared with channel-wise style code concatenation.  We first verify the importance of domain-invariant features shared by multiple domains. The starGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> also reached a similar conclusion that different domains will share the same facial context, which is beneficial to facial expression synthesis. Similarly, there are also some shared features in our multi-domain dataset, such as cell nuclei and cytoplasm membranes. We claim that the model training can benefit from incorporating multiple data domains. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the synthetic image quality improves with the increase of input data domains. For single-domain translation, the model is sensitive to different domains, where only H&amp;E staining is correct and the other two cannot be determined. This also agrees with the performance of cycleGAN in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The main reason is that the different models are built independently for single-domain image translation, resulting in the inability to share effective information among domains. When adding another domain, the model can correctly translate the background and tissue content. This can be attributed to the feature-sharing between different data domains. In addition, the triple-domain model is superior to the dualdomain ones, where all H&amp;E, PAS, and MT show clear and natural structures.  Next, we compare the AdaIN-based method and channel-wise concatenation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). We can observe that both ways can achieve correct style transfer, but from the PAS staining, the AdaIN-based method can produce plausible pathological patterns that another model fails (yellow arrows). The PAS should be stained inside the tubules, and the results from the channel-wise concatenation method will cause ambiguity in the judgment by pathologists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>This paper proposes a multiple histological image generation model for thick biological samples. This is undesirable in the traditional histopathology workflow as the chemical histological staining should be performed on the thin sections, and the same section cannot be stained with various stains simultaneously. We use slide-free microscopy to capture the thick tissues and translate the scanned images into multiple stained-versions. The model is optimized in an unsupervised manner, fitting the issue of large morphological mismatches between the scanned thick tissue and histologically stained images. Experiment results demonstrated the superiority and the great promise of the proposed method in developing a slide-free, cost-effective, and chemical-free histopathology staining pipeline.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
