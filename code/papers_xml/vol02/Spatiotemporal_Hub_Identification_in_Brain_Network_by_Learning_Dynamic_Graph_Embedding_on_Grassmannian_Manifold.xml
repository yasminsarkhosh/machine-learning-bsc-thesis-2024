<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Advancements in neuroimaging technology have made it possible to measure the connectivity evolution between different brain regions over time.</p><p>Emerging evidence shows that some critical brain regions, known as hub nodes, play a significant role in updating brain network connectivity over time. However, current spatiotemporal hub identification is built on static network-based approaches, where hub regions are identified independently for each temporal brain network without considering their temporal consistency, and fails to align the evolution of hubs with changes in connectivity dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel spatiotemporal hub identification method that utilizes dynamic graph embedding to distinguish temporal hubs from peripheral nodes. Specially, to preserve the time consistency information, we put the dynamic graph embedding learning upon a smooth physics model of network-to-network evolution, which mathematically expresses as a total variation of dynamic graph embedding with respect to time. A novel Grassmannian manifold optimization scheme is further introduced to learn the embeddings accurately and capture the time-varying topology of brain network. Experimental results on real data demonstrate the highest temporal consistency in hub identification, surpassing conventional approaches. D. Yang and H.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The human brain is a complex and economically organized system, consisting of interconnected regions that form a hierarchical brain network <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Understanding the topology of these networks is crucial for gaining insight into brain function and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Like many other real networks, brain network exhibits characteristics of a small-world and free-scale organization, where there are a small number of hub nodes that are densely connected to other peripheral regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Recent studies show that hub nodes play a central role in adapting brain network connectivity to meet task demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. It has been also observed that most neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases are associated with alterations in dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) that occur selectively on hub nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Therefore, accurate identification of hub nodes from brain networks, particularly in a dynamic scenario, is essential for understanding brain development and the neurodegenerative process.</p><p>In network science, hub nodes are often classified as provincial or connector hubs based on the information of network modules <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Provincial hubs have high connectivity within a single module, while connector hubs link multiple communities and play a more critical role in the overall network organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. With the consensus that damage to connector hubs can result in a wider disruption of the brain than damage to provincial hubs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, identifying connector hubs is location-wise and functionwise more important. Multiple hub identification methods have been proposed and can be grouped into univariate-sorting-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> and multivariate-learning-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The former involves selecting the top nodes ranked by certain nodal centrality, while the latter jointly identifies a set of critical nodes by learning topological features represented by low-dimensional graph embeddings. Although various methods exist for identifying hub nodes in brain networks, there is a notable gap in effective approaches for dynamic scenarios. One common strategy is to treat each network as a separate static network and then use existing hub identification methods for each sliding window independently to obtain a set of spatiotemporal hub nodes, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>. Where a dynamic sequence of time-varying networks is generated applying a sliding window technique to BOLD signals in fMRI imaging data. While efficient, this approach lacks an in-depth exploration of how the topological evolution is linked to hub regions, and it often produces low-consistency hubs due to a low signal-to-noise ratio, as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>.</p><p>To address these challenges, we propose a novel learning-based spatiotemporal hub identification method. Unlike existing approaches that treat each temporal network as an independent static network, our method jointly identifies a set of temporal hub nodes using a dynamic graph embedding. Specially, due to dynamic graph embedding vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> are the underlying representation of time-varying brain network, we can easily cast the network-to-network evolution over time as a total variation of dynamic graph embedding with respect to time, where each temporal graph embedding are not independent. Furthermore, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(b), as each temporal graph embedding vector is an instance residing on a Grassmannian manifold <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we leverage the Grassmannian manifold optimization scheme to learn the dynamic graph embeddings. Overall, our spatiotemporal hub identification method ensures the temporal consistency of hub nodes over time while aligning the temporal hubs with the dynamic connectivity evolution in real time. We evaluate our proposed method on both synthetic and real brain network data, and results show that it outperforms conventional approaches.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Dynamic Graph Embedding Learning</head><p>Dynamic Brain Network. Suppose we observe a time-varying brain network consisting of N brain regions, we define the network over time as a dynamic graph G = (V, E, T ), where V = {V(t)} t∈T is the node set over time, E = {E(t)} t∈T is a collection of edges over time, and T is the time span. For each temporal point t ∈ T = [0, T ], there is a graph snapshot G t of N nodes with the node-to-node connectivity degrees encoded in an N × N adjacency matrix, denoted as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W(t) = w ij N i,j=1 .</formula><p>Temporal Hub Identification. Given a temporal network G t , our goal is to find K hubs in each temporal network. The locations of these temporal hubs are indexed by a binary diagonal matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">S(t) = diag(s(t)) = diag([s i ] N i=1 )</formula><p>, where s i = 0 indicates the i th node is a hub, and s i = 1 otherwise. To achieve this, we require the latent temporal graph embedding F(t) ∈ R N ×P (P &lt; N , F(t) T F(t) = I P×P , ) for each temporal network W(t) should yield a distinct separation between connector hub nodes and the peripheral nodes. To link the learning of F(t) with the optimization of hub selection indicator s(t), we adopt the following objective function: arg min</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F(t),S(t) tr F T (t)L s (t)F(t) = tr F T (t)(D s (t) -S T (t)W(t)S(t))F(t) , (1)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L s (t) = D s (t) -S T (t)W(t)S(t) is the temporal degraded Laplacian matrix and D s (t) = diag N j=1 s i w ij s j N i=1</formula><p>is the diagonal matrix. The trace norm,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">tr F T (t)L s (t)F(t) = N i,j s i w ij s j F i (t) -F j (t) 2 2</formula><p>, measures the smoothness of graph embedding in the context of the network topology governed by L s <ref type="bibr">(t)</ref>, where F i (t) and F j (t) are the temporal embedding on nodes v i and v j . Suppose v i is the temporal hub node and v j is the linked non-hub node. Specifically, we want the distance term F i (t) -F j (t) 2  2 to be as large as possible to separate hub and peripheral nodes, while expecting that connector hubs, which have a higher connectivity degree than peripheral nodes, will have a large weight w ij . Thus, identifying hub is searching for a solution that excluding all K hub nodes (let s i = 0) from the objective function to minimize the trace norm.</p><p>Physics-Based Network Evolution Model. Since a temporal network evolves from the previous temporal state, the physics network-to-network evolution model can be mathematically described as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">F(t) = F(t -τ ) + ∂F(t) ∂t τ, (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where τ is the time interval and ∂F(t) ∂t denotes the network-to-network evolution rate. In the context of neurobiological signals, the evolution of network connectivity is a smooth process rather than a mutational change. This means that as the time interval between two consecutive network states approaches zero, the 2-norm difference between two consecutive networks (F(t) and F(t -τ )) approaches a finite value, i.e., </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">F(t),S(t) T 0 tr F T (t) D s (t) -S T (t)W(t)S(t) F(t) dt + α T 0 ∂F(t) ∂t 2 2 dt,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>which includes two terms: the identification of temporal hub sets S(t) over time using the learned dynamic graph embedding F(t), and the regularization term that enforces the smoothness of F(t) evolution over time. The scalar parameter α controls the trade-off between the two terms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Optimization on Grassmannian Manifold</head><p>Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">3</ref>) involves an integral-differential form with respect to (w.r.t) F(t) and is hard to solve directly. To address this issue, we divide the entire time series into M segments with an interval of t = T M , where lim M →∞ T M = 0. This allows us to decompose Eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments and Results</head><p>We assess the performance of our spatiotemporal hub identification method on both simulated and real network data. Our proposed method, named Dynamic-Graph-Embedding-based method, not only learns the topological features of each temporal network but also jointly learns the evolving consistency pattern on the entire dynamic sequence. We compare our method with conventional approaches: the classic sortingbased hub identification method that uses nodal betweenness centrality <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> (referred to as Sorting-Betweenness-based method), and the multivariate-learning-based hub identification that learns the topological property independently for each temporal network ( Graph-Embedding-based method <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Accuracy and Robustness on Synthesized Network Data</head><p>Data Preparation. A set of synthesized time-variant networks were generated by the folling steps: (1) initialize a network with a specified number of nodes and connections;</p><p>(2) set an evolution ratio (updated/total) to simulate the gradual process of network evolution. This involves keeping a fixed proportion of connections in the final state, while updating the remaining connections to generate the evolved network. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows toy examples of the synthesized time-varying network. Robustness. To further quantify the robustness of our proposed spatiotemporal hub identification method, we varied the complexity of network evolution and the network topology by changing the evolution ratio and hub number. Each time-varying network underwent 50 evolutions. The performance was evaluated by changing the evolution ratio from 40% to 70% and increasing the hub number in each temporal network while fixing other variables. We repeated the process 50 times and reported the overlap ratio between the identified temporal hubs and the ground truth across the entire dynamic sequence. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows that our proposed method consistently outperformed conventional methods, demonstrating its superior reliability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Evaluation of Hub Identification on Real Brain Networks</head><p>Data Preparation. A total of 125 subjects consisting of 63 normal control (NC) and 62 obsessive-compulsive disease (OCD) were selected from an obsessive-compulsive  Consistency of Hub Topology. We employed conventional engineering methods and our proposed spatiotemporal hub identification technique on each sliding window across subjects, as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. The emerging evidence suggests that hubs remain stable even when switching brain states between tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Thus, it is also reasonable for us to hypothesize that hubs remain stable underlying a resting-state environment. Our proposed Dynamic-Graph-Embedding-based method yielded the highest consistency of hub locations across temporal states (6 common hubs), followed by the Graph-Embeddingbased (5 common hubs) and Sorting-Betweenness-based methods (4 common hubs).</p><p>To further quantify the similarity, we calculated the covariance of the count histogram between the last and current temporal states, and our method exhibited the highest similarity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(c)). Statistical Power of the Identified Hubs. As mounting evidence suggests that certain neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric diseases selectively damage hub regions, we performed a two-sample t-test to assess the statistical power of the identified hub. We identified hubs for each subject at each temporal point and then voted out the eight most frequently selected nodes as the common hubs across the entire temporal series, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. The significance was indicated by red stars. Our proposed spatiotemporal hub identification method yielded more hub nodes manifesting significant differences specific to OCD compared to the other two methods (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5(a)</ref>).</p></div>
