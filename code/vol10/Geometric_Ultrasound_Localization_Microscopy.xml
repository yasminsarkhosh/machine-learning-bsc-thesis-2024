<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) has revolutionized medical imaging by enabling sub-wavelength resolution from images acquired by piezo-electric transducers and computational beamforming. However, the necessity of beamforming for ULM remains questionable. Our work challenges the conventional assumption that beamforming is the ideal processing step for ULM and presents an alternative approach based on geometric reconstruction from Time-of-Arrival (ToA) information.</p><p>The discovery of ULM has recently surpassed the diffraction-limited spatial resolution and enabled highly detailed visualization of the vascularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. ULM borrows concepts from super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques to precisely locate individual particles with sub-pixel accuracy over multiple frames. By the accumulation of all localizations over time, ULM can produce a superresolved image, providing researchers and clinicians with highly detailed representation of the vascular structure.</p><p>While Contrast-Enhanced Ultra-Sound (CEUS) is used in the identification of musculoskeletal soft tissue tumours <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the far higher resolution capability offered by ULM has great potential for clinical translation to improve the reliability of cancer diagnosis (i.e., enable differentiation of tumour types in kidney cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> or detect breast cancer tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). Moreover, ULM has shown promise in imaging neurovascular activity after visual stimulation (functional ULM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The pioneering study by Errico et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> initially demonstrated the potential of ULM by successfully localizing contrast agent particles (microbubbles) using a 2D point-spread-function model. In general, the accuracy in MicroBubble (MB) localization is the key to achieving sub-wavelength resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, for which classical imaging methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, as well as deep neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, have recently been reported. However, the conventional approach for ULM involves using computational beamformers, which may not be ideal for MB localization. For example, a recent study has shown that ultrasound image segmentation can be learned from radiofrequency data and thus without beamforming <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Beamforming techniques have been developed to render irregular topologies, whereas MBs exhibit a uniform geometric structure, for which ULM only requires information about its spatial position. Although the impact of adaptive beamforming has been studied</p><p>for ULM to investigate its potential to refine MB localization <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, optimization of the Point-Spread Function (PSF) poses high demands on the transducer array, data storage, and algorithm complexity.</p><p>To this end, we propose an alternative approach for ULM, outlined in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, that entirely relies on Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDoA) information, omitting beamforming from the processing pipeline for the first time. We demonstrate a novel geometry framework for MB localization through ellipse intersections to overcome limitations inherent to beamforming. This approach provides a finer distinction between overlapping and clustered spots, improving localization precision, reliability, and computation efficiency. In conclusion, we challenge the conventional wisdom that beamforming is necessary for ULM and propose a novel approach that entirely relies on TDoA information for MB localization. Our proposed approach demonstrates promising results and indicates a considerable trade-off between precision, computation, and memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Method</head><p>Geometric modeling is a useful approach for locating landmarks in space. One common method involves using a Time-of-Flight (ToF) round-trip setup that includes a transmitter and multiple receivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This setup is analogous to the parallax concept in visual imaging, where a triangle is formed between the target, emitter, and receivers, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The target's location can be accurately estimated using trilateration by analyzing the time delay between the transmitted and received signals. However, the triangle's side lengths are unknown in the single receiver case, and all possible travel path candidates form triangles with equal circumferences fixed at the axis connecting the receiver and the source. These candidates reside on an elliptical shape. By adding a second receiver, its respective ellipse intersects with the first one resolving the target's 2-D position. Thus, the localization accuracy depends on the ellipse model, which is parameterized by the known transducer positions and the time delays we seek to estimate. This section describes a precise echo feature extraction, which is essential for building the subsequent ellipse intersection model. Finally, we demonstrate our localization refinement through clustering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Feature Extraction</head><p>Feature extraction of acoustic signals has been thoroughly researched <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. To leverage the geometric ULM localization, we wish to extract Time-of-Arrival (ToA) information (instead of beamforming) at sub-wavelength precision. Despite the popularity of deep neural networks, which have been studied for ToA detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we employ an energy-based model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for echo feature extraction to demonstrate the feasibility of our geometric ULM at the initial stage. Ultimately, future studies can combine our proposed localization with a supervised network. Here, echoes f (m k ; t) are modeled as Multimodal Exponentially-Modified Gaussian Oscillators (MEMGO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f (m k ; t) = α k exp - (t -μ k ) 2 2σ 2 k 1 + erf η k t -μ k σ k √ 2 cos (ω k (t -μ k ) + φ k ) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where t ∈ R T denotes the time domain with a total number of T samples and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">m k = [α k , μ k , σ k , η k , ω k , φ k ] ∈ R 6 contains the amplitude α k , mean μ k , spread σ k , skew η k ,</formula><p>angular frequency ω k and phase φ k for each echo k. Note that erf(•) is the error function. To estimate these parameters iteratively, the cost function is given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L E ( mn ) = y n (t) - K k=1 f (m k ; t) 2 2 , (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where y n (t) is the measured signal from waveform channel n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N} and the sum over k accumulates all echo components mn = [m 1 , m 2 , . . . , m K ] . We get the best echo feature set m n over all iterations j via,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">m n = arg min m(j) n L E m(j) n ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>for which we use the Levenberg-Marquardt solver. Model-based optimization requires initial estimates to be nearby the solution space. For this, we detect initial ToAs via gradient-based analysis of the Hilbert-transformed signal to set m(1) n as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Before geometric localization, one must ensure that detected echo components correspond to the same MB. In this work, echo matching is accomplished in a heuristic brute-force fashion. Given an echo component m n,k from a reference channel index n, a matching echo component from an adjacent channel index n ± g with gap g ∈ N is found by k + h in the neighborhood of h ∈ {-1, 0, 1}. A corresponding phase-precise ToA t n,k is obtained by t n±g,k = μ n±g,k+h +φ n,k -Δ , which takes μ n,k and φ n,k from m n for phase-precise alignment across transducer channels after upsampling. Here, Δ is a fixed offset to accurately capture the onset of the MB locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We validate echo correspondence through a re-projection error in adjacent channels and reject those with weak alignment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Ellipse Intersection</head><p>While ellipse intersections can be approximated iteratively, we employ Eberly's closed-form solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> owing to its fast computation property. Although one might expect that the intersection of arbitrarily placed ellipses is straightforward, it involves advanced mathematical modelling due to the degrees of freedom in the ellipse positioning. An ellipse is drawn by radii (r a , r b ) of the major and minor axes with,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">r a = t n,k 2 , and r b = 1 2 t n,k 2 -ûs -u n 2 2 , (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where the virtual transmitter ûs ∈ R 2 and each receiver u n ∈ R 2 with channel index n represent the focal points of an ellipse, respectively. For the intersection, we begin with the ellipse standard equation. Let any point s ∈ R 2 located on an ellipse and displaced by its center c n ∈ R 2 such that, where M contains the ellipse equation with v n and v ⊥ n as a pair of orthogonal ellipse direction vectors, corresponding to their radial extents (r 0 , r 1 ) as well as the squared norm • 2  2 and vector norm | • |. For subsequent root-finding, it is the goal to convert the standard Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">5</ref>) to a quadratic polynomial with coefficients b j given by, B(x, y) = b 0 + b 1 x + b 2 y + b 3 x 2 + b 4 xy = 0, which, when written in vector-matrix form reads,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(s -c n ) v n 2 2 r 2 a |v n | 2 + v ⊥ n 2 2 r 2 b |v ⊥ n | 2 (s -c n ) = (s -c n ) M (s -c n ) = 1,<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">0 = x y b 3 b 4 /2 b 4 /2 b 5 x y + b 1 b 2 x y + b 0 = s Bs + b s + b 0 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where B and b carry high-order polynomial coefficients b j found via matrix factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. An elaborated version of this is found in the supplementary material.</p><p>Let two intersecting ellipses be given as quadratic equations A(x, y) and B(x, y) with coefficients a j and b j , respectively. Their intersection is found via polynomial root-finding of the equation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">D(x, y) = d 0 + d 1 x + d 2 y + d 3 x 2 + d 4 xy = 0,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where ∀j, d j = a jb j . When defining y = w -(a 2 + a 4 x)/2 to substitute y, we get A(x, w) = w 2 + (a 0 + a 1 x + a 3 x 2 ) -(a 2 + a 4 x) 2 /4 = 0 which after rearranging is plugged into <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> to yield an intersection point s i = [x i , w i ] . We refer the interested reader to the insightful descriptions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for further implementation details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Clustering</head><p>Micro bubble reflections are dispersed across multiple waveform channels yielding groups of location candidates for the same target bubble. Localization deviations result from ToA variations, which can occur due to atmospheric conditions, receiver clock errors, and system noise. Due to the random distribution of corresponding ToA errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, we regard these candidates as clusters. Thus, we aim to find a centroid p of each cluster using multiple bi-variate probability density functions of varying sample sizes by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">m(p (j) ) = s i ∈Ω (j) exp s i -p (j) 2 2 s i s i ∈Ω (j) exp s i -p (j) 2 2 (8)</formula><p>Here, the bandwidth of the kernel is set to λ/4. The Mean Shift algorithm updates the estimate p (j) by setting it to the weighted mean density on each iteration j until convergence. In this way, we obtain the position of the target bubble.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>Dataset: We demonstrate the feasibility of our geometric ULM and present benchmark comparison outcomes based on the PALA dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This dataset is chosen as it is publicly available, allowing easy access and reproducibility of our results. To date, it is the only public ULM dataset featuring Radio Frequency (RF) data as required by our method. Its third-party simulation data makes it possible to perform a numerical quantification and direct comparison of different baseline benchmarks for the first time, which is necessary to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p><p>Metrics: For MB localization assessment, the minimum Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the estimated p and the nearest ground truth position is computed. To align with the PALA study <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, only RMSEs less than λ/4 are considered true positives and contribute to the total RMSE of all frames. In cases where the RMSE distance is greater than λ/4, the estimated p is a false positive. Consequently, ground truth locations without an estimate within the λ/4 neighbourhood are false negatives. We use the Jaccard Index to measure the MB detection capability, which considers both true positives and false negatives and provides a robust measure of each algorithm's performance. The Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) is used for image assessment.</p><p>For a realistic analysis, we employ the noise model used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which is given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">n(t) ∼ N (0, σ 2 p ) × max(y n (t)) × 10 (LA+LC )/20 ± max(y n (t)) × 10 LC /20 , (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>where σ p = √ B × 10 P/10 and N (0, σ 2 p ) are normal distributions with mean 0 and variance σ 2 p . Here, L C and L A are noise levels in dB, and n(t) is the array of length T containing the random values drawn from this distribution. The additive noise model is then used to simulate a waveform channel y n (t) = y n (t)+ n(t) g(t, σ f ) suffering from noise, where represents the convolution operator, and g(t, σ f ) is the one-dimensional Gaussian kernel with standard deviation σ f = 1.5. To mimic the noise reduction achieved through the use of sub-aperture beamforming with 16 transducer channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, we multiplied the RF data noise by a factor of 4 for an equitable comparison.</p><p>Baselines: We compare our approach against state-of-the-art methods that utilize beamforming together with classical image filterings <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Spline interpolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Radial Symmetry (RS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and a deep-learning-based U-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for MB localization. To only focus on the localization performance of each algorithm, we conduct the experimental analysis without temporal tracking. We obtain the results for classical image processing approaches directly from the open-source code provided by the authors of the PALA dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. As there is no publicly available implementation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to date, we model and train the U-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> according to the paper description, including loss design, layer architecture, and the incorporation of dropout. Since the U-Net-based localization is a supervised learning approach, we split the PALA dataset into sequences 1-15 for testing and 16-20 for training and validation, with a split ratio of 0.9, providing a sufficient number of 4500 training frames.</p><p>Results: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides the benchmark comparison results with state-of-theart methods. Our proposed geometric inference indicates the best localization performance represented by an average RMSE of around one-tenth of a wavelength. Also, the Jaccard Index reflects an outperforming balance of true positive and false negative MB detections by our approach. These results support the hypothesis that our proposed geometric localization inference is a considerable alternative to existing beamforming-based methods. Upon closer examination of the channels column in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, it becomes apparent that our geometric ULM achieves reasonable localization performance with only a fraction of the 128 channels available in the transducer probe. Using more than 32 channels improves the Jaccard Index but at the expense of computational resources. This finding confirms the assumption that transducers are redundant for MB tracking. The slight discrepancy in SSIM scores between our 128-channel results and the 64channel example may be attributed to the higher number of false positives in the former, which decreases the overall SSIM value. We provide rendered ULM image regions for visual inspection in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> with full frames in the supplementary material. To enhance visibility, all images are processed with sRGB and additional gamma correction using an exponent of 0.9. The presence of noisy points in Figs. 3b to 3d is attributed to the exces- sive false positive localizations, resulting in poorer SSIM scores. Overall, these visual observations align with the numerical results presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. An NVIDIA RTX2080 GPU was used for all computations and time measurements. To improve performance, signal processing chains are often pipelined, allowing for the simultaneous computation of subsequent processes. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> lists the most time-consuming process for each method, which acts as the bottleneck. For our approach, the MEMGO feature extraction is the computationally most expensive process, followed by clustering. However, our method contributes to an overall efficient computation and acquisition time, as it skips beamforming and coherent compounding <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> with the latter reducing the capture interval by two-thirds.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents the results for the best-of-3 algorithms at various noise levels L C . As the amount of noise from (9) increases, there is a decline in the Jaccard Index, which suggests that each method is more susceptible to false detections from noise clutter. Although our method is exposed to higher noise in the RF domain, it is seen that L C has a comparable impact on our method. However, it is important to note that the U-Net yields the most steady and consistent results for different noise levels. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Summary</head><p>This study explored whether a geometric reconstruction may serve as an alternative to beamforming in ULM. We employed an energy-based model for feature extraction in conjunction with ellipse intersections and clustering to pinpoint contrast agent positions from RF data available in the PALA dataset. We carried out a benchmark comparison with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our geometric model provides enhanced resolution and detection reliability with fewer transducers. This capability will be a stepping stone for 3-D ULM reconstruction where matrix transducer probes typically consist of 32 transducers per row only. It is essential to conduct follow-up studies to evaluate the high potential of our approach in an extensive manner before entering a pre-clinical phase. The promising results from this study motivate us to expand our research to more RF data scenarios. We believe our findings will inspire further research in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
