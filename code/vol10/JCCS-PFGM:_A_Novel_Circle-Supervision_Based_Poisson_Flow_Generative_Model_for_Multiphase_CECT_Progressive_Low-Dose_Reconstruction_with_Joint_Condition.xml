<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The substantial reduction of scanning radiation dose and its accurate reconstruction are of great clinical significance for multiphase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) imaging. 1) Multiphase CECT requires multiple scans at different phases, such as arterial phase, venous phase, delayed phase and etc., to demonstrate the anatomy and lesion with the contrast agent evolution intra human body over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. But such multiphase scans inherently lead to the accumulation of huge radiation dose for patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3]</ref>. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a), after triple-phase CECT scanning, the radiation damage suffered by the patient is three times that of the single phase. Combined with "as low as reasonably achievable" (ALARA) principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, it is thus extremely urgent to greatly reduce the radiation dose and risk for clinical multiphase CECT examination. 2) However, the low-dose acquired CT image also exists the problems of noise interference and unclear structure. As enlarged region shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(b), the low-dose CECT behaves much lower signal-to-noise ratio than normal-dose CECT. It brings great difficulty to read the anatomical structure with high noise, especially for inexperienced radiologist. Therefore, the high-quality reconstruction with more readable pattern is clinically crucial for multi-phase low-dose CECT diagnosis. As far as we know, most of the existing methods mainly focus on the singlephase low-dose CT (LDCT) reconstruction. Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> trained a deep CNN to transform LDCT images towards normal-dose CT images, patch by patch. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>, a shortcut connections aided symmetrical CNN was adopt to predict noise distribution in LDCT. Shan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref> attempted to transfer a trained 2D CNN to a 3D counterpart for low-dose CT image denoising. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, an attention residual dense network was developed for LDCT sinogram data denoising. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, low-dose sinogram-and image-domain networks were trained in a progressive way. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> further connected sinogram-and image-domain networks together for joint training. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, parallel network architectures were put forward for dual-domain information exchange and mutual optimization.</p><p>Multi-phase low-dose CT reconstruction is still ignored, though single-phase methods behave promising results on their issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. Due to multiple scans in a short time, it has the inherent challenges: 1) The serious noise pollution is caused by the higher requirement of using much lower scanning dose to decrease multiphase radiation accumulation, compared to the single-phase imaging. Thus, how to elegantly learn such mapping relation from the lower-dose CECT with more serious noise to normal-dose CECT is extremely critical. 2) Complex multiphase correlation with redundancy and interference is induced by the evolution of contrast agent in the human body. Except redundancy and interference, strong causality also obviously exists among multiphase. But how to deeply explore such consistency and evolution along the multiphase for further reducing the dose of later phase and improving imaging quality is still an open challenge.</p><p>In this paper, guided with Joint Condition, a novel Circle-Supervision based Poisson Flow Generative Model (JCCS-PFGM) is proposed to make the progressive low-dose reconstruction for multiphase CECT. It deeply explores the correlation among multiphase and the mapping learning of PFGM, to progressively reduce the scanning radiation dose of multiphase CECT to the ultra low level of 5% dose, and achieve the high-quality reconstruction with noise reduction and structure maintenance. It thus significantly reduces the radiation risk of multiple CT scans in a short time, accompanied with clear multiphase CECT examination images. The main contributions of JCCS-PFGM can be summarized as: 1) an effectively progressive low-dose reconstruction mechanism is developed to leverages the imaging consistency and radiocontrast evolution along formerlatter phases, so that enormously reduces the radiation dose needs and improve the reconstruction effect, even for the latter-phase scanning with extremely low dose; 2) a newly-designed circle-supervision strategy is proposed in PFGM to enhance the refactoring capabilities of normalized poisson field learned from the perturbed space to the specified CT image space, so that boosts the explicit reconstruction for noise reduction; 3) a novel joint condition is designed to explore correlation between former phases and current phase, so that extracts the complementary information for current noisy CECT and guides the reverse process of diffusion jointly with multiphase condition for structure maintenance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methodology</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the proposed JCCS-PFGM is progressively performed on multiphase low-dose CECT to reduce the radiation risk in multiple CT imaging and make the high-quality reconstruction with noise reduction and structure maintenance. It is conducted with three special designs: 1) the progressive low-dose reconstruction mechanism (detailed in Sect. 2.1) reasonably utilizes the consistency along the multiphase CECT imaging, via phase-by-phase reducing the radiation dose and introducing the priori knowledge from former-phase reconstruction; 2) the circle-supervision strategy (detailed in Sect. 2.2) embedded in PFGM makes further self-inspection on normal poisson field prediction, via penalizing the deviation between the same-perturbed secondary diffusion; and 3) the joint condition (detailed in Sect. 2.3) integrates the multi-phase consistency and evolution in guiding the reverse process of diffusion, via fusing the complementary information from former phases into current ultra low-dose CECT. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Progressive Low-Dose Reconstruction Mechanism</head><p>The progressive low-dose reconstruction mechanism effectively promotes highlevel base from former-phase to latter-phase for successively multiphase CECT reconstruction, instead of the casually equal dose reduction seriously breaking the structure in each phase. It further exploits the inherent consistency traceable along multiphase CECT to reduce the burden of multiphase reconstruction.</p><p>As show in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a), the reasonable-designed progressive low-dose reconstruction mechanism arranges the dose from relatively high to low along the causal multiphase of phases I, II and III. With such mechanism, the reconstruction of former phase acquire more scanning information, benefit from relatively high dose. And the latter phase is granted with much more reliable priori knowledge, benefit from the consistently traceable former-phase reconstruction. Denote the low-dose CECT at phases I, II and III as x phase-I , x phase-II and x phase-III , the procedure is formulated as: where y phase-I , y phase-II and y phase-III represent reconstruction result, as well as R 1 (•), R 2 (•) and R 3 (•) mean reconstruction model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Circle-Supervision Strategy Embedded in PFGM</head><p>The circle-supervision strategy robustly boosts the refactoring capabilities of normalized Poisson field learned by PFGM. So that it further promotes the explicit reconstruction for noise reduction, instead of just CT-similar image generation.</p><p>PFGM is good at mapping a uniform distribution on a high-dimensional hemisphere into any data distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. It is inspired by electrostatics, and interpret initial image data points as electrical charges on the z = 0 hyperplane. Thus the initial image is able to be transformed into a uniform distribution on the hemisphere with radius r → ∞. It estimates normalized Poisson field with deep neural network (DNN) and thus further uses backward ordinary differential equation (ODE) to accelerate sampling.</p><p>Here, we further propose the circle-supervision strategy on the normalized Poisson field which reflects the mapping direction from the perturbed space to the specified CT image space. It remedies the precise perception on the target initial CECT besides mapping direction learning, to enhance the crucial field components. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, after randomly yield perturbed image through forward process, the DNN estimates the normalized Poisson field φ 1 . Then according to the normalized field calculation in the forward process, the Poisson field is returned with denormalization operation, and further temporarily restore the perturbed image into the initial CECT space. The secondary diffusion is conducted with same perturbtion in forward process and DNN in reverse process. Finally, the normal Poisson field of the secondary diffusion φ 2 is estimated. The deviation between φ 1 and φ 2 is penalized to boost the refactoring capabilities. Besides the temporary CECT is also yield in the secondary diffusion to enhance the robustness. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The joint condition comprehensively fuses the consistency and evolution from the former phases to enhance the current ultra low-dose CECT (take the phase III low-dose CECT reconstruction for example). It is composed of self-fusion among former phases for consistency, and cross-fusion between former and current phases for evolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Joint Condition Fusing Multiphase Consistency and Evolution</head><p>The joint condition comprehensively fuses the consistency and evolution from the previous phases to enhance the current ultra low-dose CECT. With such multiphase fusion, the reverse process of diffusion is able to get the successive guide to perceive radiocontrast evolution for structure maintenance As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, the joint condition consists of two parts: the self-fusion among previous phases for consistency and the cross-fusion between previous  and current phases for evolution. 1) For the self-fusion among former phases, it firstly encodes the combination of the reconstruction results of the previous phase I y phase-I and phase II y phase-II into the feature domain. And key map K pre , query map Q pre and value map V pre are then generated with further encoder and permutation. K pre and Q pre together establish the correlation weight, i.e., attention map Att pre , among former phases combination to explore the inherent consistency. Att pre further works on the value map V pre to extract the consistent information which is finally added on the first feature representation to get previous-phases embedding feat pre . The procedure is formulated as: 2) For the cross-fusion between previous and current phases, it uses feat pre to generate query map Q cur and value map V cur . The current phase III low-dose CECT x phase-III is encoded for key map K cur . Thus the evolution between the current phase and previous phases is explored between K cur and Q cur by attention map Att cur . Then complimentary evolution from previous phases is extracted from value map V cur with Att cur , and then added into the current phase. The procedure is formulated as: </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ K pre = E K-pre (E pre ([y phase-I , y phase-II ])) Q pre = E Q-pre (E pre ([y phase-I , y phase-II ])) V pre = E V -pre (E pre ([y phase-I , y phase-II ])) feat pre = Conv(Sof tmax(Q pre K pre / √ d)V pre ) + E pre ([y phase-I , y phase-II ]) (2) where E pre (•),E K-pre (•),E Q-pre (•) and E V -pre (•)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ K cur = EK-</formula><p>3 Experiments  </p></div>
