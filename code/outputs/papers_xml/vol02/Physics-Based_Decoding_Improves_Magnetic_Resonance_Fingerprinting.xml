<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is a promising approach for fast Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (QMRI). However, existing MRF methods suffer from slow imaging speeds and poor generalization performance on radio frequency pulse sequences generated in various scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel MRI physics-informed regularization for MRF. The proposed approach adopts a supervised encoder-decoder framework, where the encoder performs the main task, i.e. predicting the target tissue properties from input magnetic responses, and the decoder servers as a regularization via reconstructing the inputs from the estimated tissue properties using a Bloch-equation based MRF physics model. The physics-based decoder improves the generalization performance and uniform stability by a considerable margin in practical out-of-distribution settings.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (QMRI) is used to identify tissue's intrinsic physical properties, including the spin-lattice magnetic relaxation time (T1), and the spin-spin magnetic relaxation time (T2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Compared to conventional weighted (qualitative) MRI that focuses on tissue's contrast of brightness and darkness, QMRI reveals tissue's intrinsic properties with quantitative values and associated physical interpretations. Since different tissues are characterized by their distinct properties values, QMRI shows great potential to reduce subjectivity, with advantages in many areas including diagnosis, tissue characterization, investigation of disease pathologies, personalized medical treatment, and therapeutic assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</p><p>Despite various benefits, most QMRI approaches suffer from slow imaging speeds, and usually provide only a single intrinsic property at a time (e.g., quantification of T1 alone, followed by T2 alone), resulting in low throughput. Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) provides an alternative QMRI framework to achieve multi-property quantification simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Given a pseudorandom radio frequency (RF) pulse sequence, a distinct magnetic response, i.e., fingerprint/signature, from each specific tissue is observed and then used to predict the target intrinsic tissue properties, e.g., T1 and T2 values. Therefore, multi-property quantification boils down to an inverse problem that aims to infer underlying tissue properties from the observed magnetic responses.</p><p>In this work, we propose an MRI physics-regularized deep learning model for fast and robust MRF, called BlochNet as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. BlochNet adopts a supervised encoder-decoder framework where the encoder network solves the primary inverse problem that predicts tissue properties from input magnetic responses, while the decoder acts as a regularizer that guides the training of the encoder. In particular, the decoder leverages a Bloch equations-based MRI physics model to reconstruct the input responses from the estimated tissue properties, and compares the reconstructed inputs with the original input to provide an additional loss for the regularization purpose.</p><p>The rationale underlying the design is that domain knowledge such as wellfounded physics principles bring additional useful constraints that can effectively reduce the solution space of an inverse problem. This contributes to an optimized solution, in particular, for an (ill-posed) inverse problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Our results verify that the proposed approach exhibits improved robustness and generalization performance in both synthetic and real MRF data in two different out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. The major contributions include:</p><p>-The proposed BlochNet incorporates an MRI physics model to the decoding mechanism, which plays a role to regularize the training of the encoder. We expect that such a physics-based design can provide useful training signals for the encoder to better solve the MRF problems. -We improve the efficiency of the implementation of the Bloch equations, which reduce the computation overhead such that the MRI physics-based decoding model can be used directly as a differentiable module and trained end-to-end in neural networks (e.g., the decoder in BlochNet). -Compared to existing methods, BlochNet shows consistently better generalization performance across synthetic, phantom and real MRF data, and across different types of RF pulse sequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background and Related Works</head><p>Since tissue properties lead to magnetic responses according to the MRI dynamics, quantifying tissue's properties via QMRI/MRF is a typical inverse problem, also an anti-causal task. The core idea of MRF is based on the fact that for each specific tissue, a pseudo-random pulse sequence leads to a unique magnetic response (i.e., magnetization along the temporal dimension) which can serve as an identifiable signal signature, analogous to a "fingerprint" for the corresponding tissue. Once the unique identifiable magnetic responses are obtained, the estimation of tissue properties reduces to a pattern recognition problem.</p><p>Various approaches have been developed to solve the MRF problem, using either model-based techniques, e.g., dictionary matching (DM), compressive sensing, or learning-based / data-driven techniques.</p><p>Model-Based Approaches. In the original MRF work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, this task is approached via dictionary matching (DM) which finds the best matching entry in a pre-computed dictionary for each inquiry magnetic response. Accordingly, the best matching dictionary entry leads to multiple tissue properties directly via a look-up-table (LUT) operation. To alleviate the extensive computation overhead and storage burden, a number of model-based MRF approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> were proposed to incorporate additional useful priors, e.g. sparsity, low rank, in order to improve reconstruction performance as well as reduce computational complexity.</p><p>Learning-Based Approaches. To address some shortcomings of model-based methods, learning-based approaches have been proposed for fast MRF by replacing the dictionary with a compact neural network. In particular, motivated by the success of deep learning in a number of tasks, there is an emerging trend <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> that suggests to use a trained neural network as a substitute for the MRF dictionary and LUT, so that the time-consuming dictionary matching operation can be avoided and replaced by an efficient inference through a trained network. However, despite the good performance delivered by neural networks, most of the learning-based methods were designed without taking into account the MRI physics underlying the imaging process, and may inevitably suffer from some limitations, such as degraded robustness and generalizability.</p><p>Physics-Informed Learning. Another highly related line of research is modelbased learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> which provides a promising path to integrate domain knowledge with learned priors, thereby fusing the benefits of model-based methods with learning-based methods. Typical examples include algorithm unrolling <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and other variants. Incorporating physics priors into the neural network design and training has demonstrated benefits in a broad range of applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, in particular for medical imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. In a similar spirit, we aim to incorporate the physics model that describes the MRI dynamics into learning-based MRF approaches so that the learned model can demonstrate improved data efficiency, robustness and generalization. Note that, in contrast to standard PINNs which are used to solve a PDE, our task is to solve an inverse PDE. Furthermore, we propose to leverage the PDE as a regularization. (More related work and comparisons are provided in the Appendix.)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">BlochNet: Regularized Networks by Physics-Based Decoding</head><p>The proposed BlochNet adopts a supervised encoder-decoder framework where the encoder solves the primary inverse problem that predicts tissue properties from input magnetic responses, while the decoder solves an auxiliary task that reconstructs the inputs from the estimated tissue properties using the Bloch equations-based MRI physics model. We highlight that a sophisticated MRI physics model is tailored and exploited as the decoder. The rationale behind such a design lies in the fact that the data generation mechanism represented by MRI physics is a useful constraint that can effectively reduce the solution space of the inverse problem. Therefore, the physics-based decoder will act as a strong regularizer that can provide informative feedback and contribute to the training of a better encoder. We expect the physics prior can introduce a better and generalizable inductive bias to the encoder. Similar ideas have been explored in some other domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, in the proposed approach, the encoder uses a three-layer fully connected neural network to address the inverse problem that predicts T1, T2 tissue properties from input magnetic responses. Given an enquiry magnetic response X n ∈ C L for the n-th voxel where L denotes the length of each magnetic response, e.g. L = 1000 in our experiments, the encoder E outputs predicted tissue properties Θn = { T 1 n , T 2 n } ∈ R p where p = 2 denotes the number of tissue properties to be predicted.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Θn = E(X n ) ∀n ∈ 1, . . . , N</formula><p>Note that, the estimation of tissue properties Θ from magnetic responses X requires long enough sequences L &gt; p to create identifiable signal evolutions that distinguish different tissues. Hence, this operation nonlinearly maps the magnetic responses from a high-dimensional manifold to a low-dimensional manifold.</p><p>In contrast, the decoder reconstructs the input magnetic responses from the estimated tissue properties Θn by solving the Bloch equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d M dt = M × γ B - ⎡ ⎣ M x /T 2 M y /T 2 (M z -M 0 )/T 1 ⎤ ⎦</formula><p>where M = [M x , M y , M z ] denotes the magnetization vector. M 0 denotes the equilibrium magnetization; B denotes the magnetic field; and γ denotes the gyromagnetic ratio. (More details of Bloch equations are provided in the Appendix.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Fast EPG for Solving Bloch Equations</head><p>Since there is no general analytic solution to the Bloch equations, numerical solutions such as EPG formalism are often adopted. However, a limitation of the released EPG implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is its slow computation speed in solving the Bloch equations. To circumvent this, recurrent neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and generative adversarial networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> have been applied as surrogates for the Bloch equation. However, these surrogate models require a lot of training data and may generate inaccurate magnetic responses on unseen tissue properties and RF pulse settings due to complex physics dynamics and potential overfitting risks.</p><p>Instead, we adapt the EPG implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> to achieve a much more efficient implementation, making it practical to use the exact MRI physics model as a decoder in the training procedure. Specifically, the adaptations involve incorporating the PyTorch jit package for efficient parallelization, using batch-wise computation for the 3 Bloch stages (including nutation+forced precession, rotation, and relaxation in Fourier domain), and handling complex values in Pytorch efficiently. The improvement leads to 500 times faster generation of magnetic responses for 1,000 sequences on CPU, making repeated EPG computations feasible during training. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> (More details can be found in the Appendix.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Loss Function</head><p>The loss function consists of two parts: the mean squared error (MSE) between the ground truth and the predicted tissue properties, referred to as embedding loss, and the MSE between the input and the reconstructed signatures, referred to as reconstruction loss,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L = 1 N N n=1 1 2 Θn -Θ n 2 2 + 1 2 Xn -X n 2 2 .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiment Results</head><p>In this section, we perform an evaluation of the proposed method and conduct a comparison with other state-of-the-art MRF methods. We evaluate the generalization performance of all models across different data distributions and different RF pulse sequences. The evaluation metric is the MSE in log-scale, and therefore, the unit is the squared millisecond in log-scale. For our model, we use 3-layer encoder-decoder with varying hidden units, Adam optimizer (lr=1e-3), and maximum epochs of 100 with early stopping based on the validation set on GTX 1080 Ti. We performed ten independent trials, the results of which are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The associated standard deviations are provided in the Appendix. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data Settings and Baseline Methods</head><p>We exploit three types of data including synthetic data, phantom MRI data, and anatomical MRI data. In particular, synthetic data (around 80,000 samples) is used for training, while phantom data (85,645 samples) and anatomical data (7,499 samples) is for evaluation. More details about the three datasets are provided in the Appendix. We compare our approach with 6 representative state-of-the-art MRF methods, including dictionary matching (DM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Fullyconnected deep neural network (FC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Hybrid deep learning (HYDRA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> as well as two auto-encoder methods with RNN encoder and RNN decoder(RNN-RNN) and FC encoder and FC decoder(FC-FC), respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Experiments of Evaluating Generalization Performance</head><p>We evaluate the generalization performance of various models on two types of experiment settings: 1) across different data distributions, including synthetic, phantom and anatomical MRF data; 2) across different RF pulse sequences with different flip angles. In addition, a series of ablation studies were conducted via comparison with other methods that use different types of decoders, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, for example, comparing BlochNet (using a physics-based decoder) with FC (using no decoder) and FC-FC (using a learned decoder) to show the effect of the encoder and the effect of MRI physics.</p><p>Generalization Across Different Data Distributions. Due to limited anatomical data with ground truth T1, T2 values, it is common practice to use a large amount of synthetic data to train models to avoid potential overfitting, and then perform validation on anatomical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Following the same routine, we perform model training on synthetic MRF data, followed by model testing on phantom and anatomical data, in order to evaluate the generalization performance of trained models across different data distributions. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> includes the mean squared error (MSE) between the ground truth and predicted tissue properties for seven approaches on phantom and anatomical data (in log-scale). As shown in the table, the dictionary-matching approach gave the worst performance, because the pre-computed dictionary and LUT did not cover the OOD data samples that could be quite different from the already contained dictionary entries. Interestingly, the results show that the reconstruction loss provides benefits to between-data generalization for autoencoder models(FC-FC or RNN-RNN), in comparison with non-autoencoder models(FC or RNN), respectively, on both phantom and anatomical MRF data. Furthermore, our BlochNet outperforms all other models, indicating that reconstruction loss from the physics-based decoder has the best regularization effect that contributes to improved encoder training.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the predicted tissue properties using various models on anatomical MRF data. Each individual model shows different prediction characteristics. Specifically, HYDRA suffers from a higher loss at the rim region of the  Generalization Across Different RF Pulse Sequences. In this experiment, we perform model training on one RF pulse sequence and evaluate the trained models on a different RF pulse sequence. Specifically, we adopted 3 different RF pulse sequences, including FISP <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Spline5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Spline11Noisy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> with their flip angles shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> in the Appendix. More details are provided in Appendix. FISP is used exclusively in the testing stage, while Spline5 and Spline11Noisy are used exclusively in the training stage. Under such settings, the performance of our BlochNet and other six models is compared in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>In spite of degraded performance for all models under different train and test RF pulse sequences, the results clearly show the advantage of autoencoder (FC-FC or RNN-RNN) models over non-autoencoder models(FC or RNN), which confirms the benefits of incorporating a decoder to derive the reconstruction loss as additional regularization. Furthermore, the proposed BlochNet demonstrates significant gains over competing methods in such challenging cases on both phantom and anatomical MRF data.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, FC model (left) makes poor predictions on both T1 and T2 values with high variance, because it cannot infer tissue properties from input signatures generated from different combinations of T1 and T2 values. Autoencoder(FC-FC) model (third column) shows more aligned and better inferences with lower variance, but still has high deviation between predicted and gold-standard values. In comparison, our BlochNet outputs predictions that are closest to the goldstandard with the lowest error. This confirms the benefits of our physics-based decoder that guides the encoder to learn the underlying anti-causal mechanism effectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>We present statistical significance tests on 10 trials for pairwise group comparisons using Tukey HSD test after the Normality Test and repeated ANOVA. For results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, corresponding to setting 1 (a relatively easy problem as the RF pulses used in training and testing are the same), our method is not always statistically better to every compared method, since all baseline methods can perform reasonably well. However, in setting 2, a much more challenging OOD setting where the RF pulses used in testing are different from those used in training and therefore can lead to different magnetic responses, our method is always statistically better (p-value &lt; 0.001) than compared methods according to the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. This demonstrates the robustness and generalizability of our method. As far as we are concerned, no existing approaches achieved satisfactory results in such an OOD case. While there is still ample room for improvement across all the methods, our approach took a critical step forward by incorporating physics knowledge. (More details can be found in the Appendix.) </p></div>
