<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A brain network, viewed as a graph wiring different regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain, has been widely used to investigate brain dysfunction with various graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs are built upon graph convolution that transforms measurements on the nodes, where ROI-wise features are not always guaranteed for brain networks. Therefore, the majority of existing graph analysis methods that rely on node features are inapplicable for network analysis unless a proxy such as node degree is provided. Moreover, the complex neurological interactions across different brain regions cannot be directly expressed in a simple node-to-node (i.e., 0-simplex) representation. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Hodge-Graph Neural Network (Hodge-GNN), that allows the GNN to directly derive desirable representations of graph edges and capture complex edge-wise topological features spatially via the Hodge Laplacian. Specifically, representing a graph as a simplicial complex holds a significant advantage over conventional methods that extract higher-order connectivity of a graph through hierarchical convolution in the spatial domain or graph transformation. The superiority of our method is validated in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, in comparison to benchmarking GNNs as well as state-of-the-art graph classification models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The wiring system within the human brain can be modeled as a complex graph, where the anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) are represented as nodes, and the white matter connectomes define edges between them <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. The graphbased representation explains actual connections between different nodes, and thus brain network analysis has a significant advantage over traditional spatial analysis to investigate interactions of different ROIs. As various neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are understood as a disconnection syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, studies on the structural connectivities in the brain are of significant interest from both machine learning and clinical perspectives.</p><p>Recently, variants of graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successful in brain network analysis with feature aggregation and message-passing mechanism on graph nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Notice that, regardless of whether it is spatial or spectral, existing methods heavily rely on graph convolution that operates with the node signals (i.e., ROI measures). Here, the topology of graph plays an indirect role as the domain of the signal, merely selecting specific neighborhood for feature aggregation. The problem becomes even more severe when it comes to actual connectivity analysis without ROI-wise measurements. To utilize GNN methods, auxiliary node-wise measures such as node degree and clustering coefficients are required to perform prediction tasks on the brain networks, and the contribution of connectomic features as a biomarker is often not fully investigated. To perform convolution on edges directly, heuristics such as line graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> or defining orthogonal matrices from graph Laplacian <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> exists, but they have disadvantages when the graph is directed or has many components.</p><p>In order to analyze the connectivity of brain networks directly, we propose a novel graph learning framework that allows a neural network to utilize the topological features by representing the brain network as a simplicial complex. We utilize the Hodge 1-Laplacian, i.e., L 1 ; in geometry, the 1-simplex denotes a line segment, and the Hodge Laplacian L 1 includes connection between different line segments (i.e., edges) in a graph depending on their directions. Leveraging the Hodge Laplacian lets us obtain directed relationships between graph edges (i.e., a brain network) as an undirected graph (i.e., Hodge Laplacian), and the edge weights in the original graph become a signal on the nodes comprehended by the Hodge Laplacian. Spatial convolution with the L 1 combines directed edge weights of the original graph based on the nodes that they are sharing. Together with a spatial graph convolution formulation, we construct our Hodge-Graph Neural Network (Hodge-GNN) which predicts labels of graphs purely based on the topology of the graphs without any node measures.</p><p>The contributions of our work are 1) proposing a novel graph edge-learning framework on higher-order connectivity (i.e., connectivity between edges) of graphs with Hodge Laplacian, 2) defining spatial edge convolution layer that operates on graph edges directly, and 3) demonstrating superior performance on graph classification with brain connectivity from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with interpretability. Using Hodge-GNN, we depict brain connectivities that are highly associated with AD classification, which are corroborated by prior AD literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Higher-order connectivity in Spatial domain. To capture the relation of higher-order graph structures, Morris et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> proposed hierarchical k-GNNs, which are hierarchical GNN architectures based on the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm. By performing message passing directly between subgraph structures, k-GNNs enable the network to capture structural information that is not observable at the node-level. Despite their superiority over 1-GNN, k-GNNs require large memory and high computational cost due to their stacking of models, showing limitation in scalability and effectiveness on large graphs. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> define range with diffusion instead of hopdistances and train on the range to obtain desirable node-embeddings.</p><p>Line Graphs. Line graph transformation interchanges the nodes and edges in the original graph respectively, allowing the node-wise graph convolution to be performed edge-wise, which makes the learning of edge-embeddings feasible <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. However, line graphs lack the property of injectivity, which implies that different graphs can be transformed into a same line graph. Edge Convolution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> performed edge convolution by creating edgeembeddings from neighboring pair of point clouds. However, the suggested method requires node features to generate the edge-embeddings without any graph prior, and thus it requires rich node features to construct strong embeddings.</p><p>Spectral Filtering of Graph Edges. Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> defined spectral filters for graph signals of nodes and edges using the k-th Hodge Laplacian (HL) operators, i.e., HL-node and HL-edge, and showed effectiveness of capturing the edge-wise relation in heterogeneous brain functional networks. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> performed kernel filtering in the spectral domain with a specialized orthonormal graph transform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Preliminaries: Simplicial Complex Representation</head><p>A simplicial complex is a collection of simplices with various dimensional representations, where simplices refer to the basic blocks to represent objects in topological space. In detail, each simplex of various dimension can be seen as nodes (0-simplex), edges (1-simplex), triangles (2-simplex), and other higher dimensional counterparts. A simplicial complex composed of only 0-simplices is called a 0-skeleton, likewise, p-skeleton is composed of 0 to p-simplices. A graph, therefore, is a 1-skeleton with 0-and 1-simplices (nodes and edges) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p><p>In a simplicial complex, a p-chain is defined as a sum of p-simplicies, denoted as c = i α i σ i , where σ i are the p-simplices and the α i are either 0 or 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. A chain complex is defined as the sequence of groups, each of which is made For an oriented p-simplex σ p , the boundary operator can be defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∂p(σ p ) = p i=0 (-1) i [v0, v1, • • • , vi, • • • , vp],<label>(1) where</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">[v 0 , v 1 , • • • , vi , • • • , v p ] is a (p -1)-simplex that is created by removing the vertex vi from the p-simplex σ p = [v 0 , v 1 , • • • , v p ] [1]</formula><p>. Also, the boundary operator ∂ p is represented using a boundary matrix B p to facilitate efficient computation of the Hodge Laplacian. The p-th boundary matrix B p can be defined as <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Bp(i, j) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 1, if σ p-1 i ⊂ σ p j and σ p-1 i ∼ σ p j -1, if σ p-1 i ⊂ σ p j and σ p-1 i σ p j 0, if σ p-1 i ⊂ σ p j (2)</formula><p>where σ p i is the i-th p-simplex, and ∼ and denote similar and dissimilar orientations respectively. The boundary matrix B p relates the two adjacent simplices, i.e., p-and (p -1)-simplex, which will be used to define the Hodge Laplacian for higher-order graph representation in Sec. 4.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Proposed Method</head><p>The proposed method is composed of two components; graph transformation of adjacency matrix to Hodge Laplacian L 1 with edge-wise features, and edgewise graph convolution using the L 1 . With the traditional graph convolution formulation, the network can conduct transform of topological features directly instead of using them as indirect measures in previous GNNs.</p></div>

The Hodge Laplacian L p is defined using the B p (i, j) in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L p = B T p B p + B p+1 B T p+1 . (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>From Eq.

As a 1-skeleton, i.e. topological graph, is composed of 0 and 1 simplex only (i.e., B 2 = 0), the L 1 ∈ R E×E is derived as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L 1 = B T 1 B 1 .

Since W holds features for each edge, we can extract the non-zero components of W, which serves as a signal W E ∈ R E on L 1 .</p></div>

H (l) ∈ R N ×K is the output of the l-th convolution layer with K features, where H (0) is the input of node feature vectors, and σ(•) is a nonlinear activation function. From a spatial perspective, the graph convolution relates the neighboring node features to generate the node embedding utilizing the adjacency matrix as a relational matrix that provides the direct neighboring information.</p><p>From a weighted adjacency matrix A ∈ R N ×N , we can extract Hodge Laplacian L 1 ∈ R E×E and W E which is a vector of edge weights considered as measurements on the nodes of L 1 . With L 1 , we construct a Hodge graph neural network (Hodge-GNN) whose l-th layer is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">H (l+1) = σ(L1H (l) W (l) ), l= 0, • • • , L,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where W (l) is a learnable weight parameter and H (l) ∈ R E×K is the output from the l-th convolution layer, with H (0) = W E .

However, when the measurements on the nodes do not exist, and the analysis must be performed solely with the graph topology and edge information, other GNN methods must define an auxiliary node-wise measures such as node degree and clustering coefficients. Unlike the previous approaches, our framework enables the information from adjacent edges to be given different weights, either positive or negative, depending on the topology of the graph, and the edge-wise convolution can now relate the edge features and generate edge embeddings, allowing the network to utilize the hidden topological features that were not seen in the original input graph form.</p><p>Finally, the class prediction Ŷ c for each class c is obtained by flattening the H (L) ∈ R E×K and passing it through multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and applying a softmax yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Ŷ c = MLP(H (L) ) c c ∈C MLP(H (L) ) c .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Dataset and Experimental Settings</head><p>Dataset. Our dataset contains structural brain connectivity data derived from Diffusion Tensor Images (DTI) in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with tractography. Each sample is given as a directed weighted graph whose weights denote the number of white matter fiber tracts connecting two different ROIs and its corresponding diagnostic label. The ROIs and their connectomes were defined by the Destrieux atlas <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> with 148 cortical and 12 sub-cortical ROIs. As tractography involves probabilistic calculation, the connectivity matrix becomes non-symmetric with varying weights on the same connectivity matrices. The dataset is composed of n=1824 subjects within Control (CN, n=844), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI, n=490), Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI, n=250), and AD (n=240) groups. Edge Preprocessing. Unlike the widely used A ∈ R N ×N or L 0 ∈ R N ×N , the adoption of L 1 ∈ R E×E incurs an exponential rise in both memory and computational costs. Also, the E across different samples varies from 2138 to 11802 (6766 in average). To handle such problems, we used the intersection of edges across entire samples. This preprocessing step yields the number of edges to be E = 530, common across all subjects.</p><p>Baselines. Our method is validated on various approaches, including conventional classification methods, neural networks, and graph methods of both spatial and spectral domain. In detail, we used support vector machine (SVM), single layer perceptron (SLP), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and GCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> with original graph G and line graph G L as the conventional classification method, as well as the hierarchical k-GNNs (1-2-GNN, 1-2-3-GNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and MENET <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> for spatial and spectral baselines respectively.

As in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, our classifier picked up connectome of ROIs in the subcortical regions (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, temporal lobe (i.e., inferior, middle, and superior temporal cortex) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, frontal lobe (i.e., superior frontal gyrus) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, and other important regions that are highly related to AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, the depicted edges showed several symmetry found in both left and right hemispheres, such as pallidum-putamen and amygdala-hippocampus connectomes, both of which play a crucial role in the development of AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Interestingly, right pallidum was shared on two detected connectivities (i.e., with right-putamen and right-thalamus-proper), which highlights the importance of pallidum connectomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Also, out of the 17 ROIs consisting the detected connectivities, 5 ROIs (pallidum, amygdala, putamen, hippocampus, and thalamus) were from subcortical regions, denoting that they are critical for our AD-stage classification and subcortical areas are highly implicated in AD as in prior works <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed a novel framework for extracting edge-to-edge relations in graph spatial domain using Hodge 1-Laplacian, i.e., Hodge-GNN. The Hodge-GNN performs graph convolution on edges via shared nodes among edges and allows a downstream predictor to accurately classify different stages of AD. The validation experiment showed superiority of performance in prediction together with interpretable outcomes depicting specific connectomes and ROIs for effective AD analysis. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1. The overall process of the proposed method: 1) deriving Hodge Laplacian L1 from input graph G. 2) edge-wise graph convolution on e with L1. 3) Each edge (orange node) aggregates the information of neighboring edges in different weights given by L1. 4) MLP takes edge-convolved features as an input and is updated by the loss.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,48,30,54,47,328,00,85,24" type="bitmap" /></figure>
