Weakly Supervised Segmentation on MRI
Brain Tumor","however, most deep learning approaches for segmentation require fully or
partially labeled training datasets, which can be time-consuming and expensive
to annotate. to address this issue, recent research has focused on developing
segmentation frameworks that require little or no segmentation labels."
"AME-CAM: Attentive Multiple-Exit CAM for
Weakly Supervised Segmentation on MRI
Brain Tumor","to meet this need, many researchers have devoted their efforts to
weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (wsss) the literature has not adequately
addressed the issue of low-resolution class-activation maps (cams), especially

Endoscopy","3d reconstruction strategies have been studied for long, and one crucial step in
these strategies is feature detection and matching which serves as input for
structure from motion (sfm) pipelines. endoscopic images are a challenging case
for feature detection and matching, due to several well known challenges for
these tasks, such as lack of texture, or the presence of frequent artifacts,
like specular reflections."
"Tracking Adaptation to Improve

deformable, as it is the case in most endoscopy scenarios, and in particular in

this information can be leveraged to assess treatment response, e.g., by
analyzing the evolution of size and morphology for a given tumor in practice,
the development of automatic and reliable lesion tracking solutions is hindered

"Learning Transferable Object-Centric
Diffeomorphic Transformations for Data
Augmentation in Medical Image
Segmentation","data augmentation (da) is a recognized approach to tackle this challenge. common
da strategies create new samples by using predefined transformations such as
rotation, translation, and colour jitter to existing data, where the performance
gains heavily relies on the choice of augmentation operations and parameters to
mitigate this reliance, recent efforts have focused on learning optimal
augmentation operations for a given task and dataset however, to date, all

the image. this assumption is restrictive and associated with several
challenges."
"Learning Transferable Object-Centric
Diffeomorphic Transformations for Data
Augmentation in Medical Image
Segmentation","first, the learning of a global image-level transformation requires image
alignment that may be non-trivial in many scenarios, such as the alignment of
tumours that can appear at different locations of an image, or alignment of
images from different modalities. the learning of transformations itself is also
complicated by the presence of other objects in the image and is best suited
when the object of interest is always in the same (and often centre) location in
all the images, i.e., images are globally aligned a priori intuitively,
object-centric transformations and augmentations have the potential to overcome
the challenges associated with global image-level transformations."

"TransLiver: A Hybrid Transformer Model
for Multi-phase Liver Lesion
Classification","liver cancer is one of the most deadly cancers and has the second highest
fatality rate a single-phase lesion annotation means the annotation of both
lesion position and its class. in hospitals, collected multi-phase cts are
normally grouped by patients rather than lesions, which makes single-phase
lesion annotation insufficient for feature fusion learning."
"TransLiver: A Hybrid Transformer Model
for Multi-phase Liver Lesion
Classification","we use additional cross phase tokens at the last stage to complete a multi-phase
fusion, which can focus on cross-phase communication and improve the fusion
effectiveness as compared with conventional modes. while most multi-phase liver

(without dl phase for its difficulty of collection) or no more than six lesion
classes, we validate the whole framework on an in-house dataset with four phases
of abdominal ct and seven classes of liver lesions."

"Continual Learning for Abdominal
Multi-organ and Tumor Segmentation","humans inherently learn in an incremental manner, acquiring new concepts over

from catastrophic forgetting the medical domain faces a similar problem: the
ability to dynamically extend a model to new classes is critical for multiple
organ and tumor segmentation, wherein the key obstacle lies in mitigating
'forgetting.' a typical strategy involves retaining some previous data."
"Continual Learning for Abdominal
Multi-organ and Tumor Segmentation","therefore, we identify two main open questions that must be addressed when
designing a multi-organ and tumor segmentation framework. q1: can we relieve the
forgetting problem without needing previous data and annotations?"
"Continual Learning for Abdominal

"Efficient Subclass Segmentation in
Medical Images",problem definition.
"Efficient Subclass Segmentation in
Medical Images","intuitively, given sufficient superclass labels in supervised learning, the
superclassification head tends to reduce feature distance among samples within
the same superclass, which conflicts with the goal of increasing the distance
between subclasses within the same superclass. to alleviate this issue, we aim
to enhance the internal diversity of the distribution within the same superclass
while preserving the discriminative features among superclasses."
"Efficient Subclass Segmentation in
Medical Images","this segmentation result is supervised by the superposition of the pseudo label
map z pse and subclass labels z, with weighting factor α: the intuition behind
this framework is to simultaneously leverage the information from both unlabeled
and labeled data by incorporating a more robust supervision from
transform-invariant pseudo labels. while mixing up only the semantic foreground
provides a way of exchanging knowledge between similar foreground objects while
lifting the confirmation bias in pseudo labeling"

to improve mri synthesis models. it shows superiority in model training however,
current dm-based methods focus on one-to-one mri translation, promising to be
improved by many-to-one methods, which requires dedicated design to balance the
multiple conditions introduced by multi-modal mri."
"CoLa-Diff: Conditional Latent Diffusion
Model for Multi-modal MRI Synthesis","-introduce structural guidance of brain regions in each step of the diffusion
process, preserving anatomical structure and enhancing synthesis quality.
-propose an auto-weight adaptation to balance multi-conditions and maximise the
chance of leveraging relevant multi-modal information."
"LightNeuS: Neural Surface Reconstruction
in Endoscopy Using Illumination Decline","colorectal cancer (crc) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and is the
second most common cause of cancer death to overcome these difficulties, we rely
on two properties of endoscopic images: -endoluminal cavities such as the
gastrointestinal tract, and in particular the human colon, are watertight
surfaces."
