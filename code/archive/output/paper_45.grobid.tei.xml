				<p>The displacement estimation step of Ultrasound Elastography (USE) can be done by optical flow Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Even though displacement estimation in USE and computer vision share some challenges, USE displacement estimation has two distinct characteristics that set it apart from the computer vision counterpart: high-frequency nature of RF data, and the physical rules that govern the motion pattern. The high-frequency nature of RF data has been well addressed in recent works by modifying the architecture of the available optical flow CNNs. However, insufficient attention has been placed on the integration of physical laws of deformation into the displacement estimation. In USE, lateral displacement estimation, which is highly required for elasticity and Poisson&apos;s ratio imaging, is a more challenging task compared to the axial one since the motion in the lateral direction is limited, and the sampling frequency is much lower than the axial one. Recently, Physically Inspired ConstrainT for Unsupervised Regularized Elastography (PICTURE) has been introduced which incorporates the physical laws of deformation by introducing a regularized loss function. PICTURE tries to limit the range of the lateral displacement by the feasible range of Poisson&apos;s ratio and the estimated high-quality axial displacement. Despite the improvement, the regularization was only applied during the training phase. Furthermore, only a feasible range for Poisson&apos;s ratio was enforced. We exploit the concept of known operators to incorporate iterative refinement optimization methods into the network architecture so that the network is forced to remain within the physically plausible displacement manifold. The refinement optimization methods are embedded into the different pyramid levels of the network architecture to improve the estimate. Our results on experimental phantom and in vivo data show that the proposed method substantially improves the estimated displacements.</p>
