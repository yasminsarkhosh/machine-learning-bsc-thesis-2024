ultrasound imaging is a very eﬀective technique for breast lesion diagnosis,

overview
the problem of detecting the intersection point is trivial when the laser is on and
can be solved by training a deep segmentation network. however, segmentation
requires images with a laser spot as input, while the real gamma probe produces
no visible mark and therefore this approach produces inferior results."

sfm method requires the surgeon to constantly move the laparoscope, reducing
the practicality of these methods for surgery. in this work, we propose a simple, yet eﬀective regression approach to address
this problem. our approach relies solely on the 2d information and works well
without the need for the laser module after training."

works progressively. however, developing a good diﬃculty metric or measurer

the early stages. in addition, while deep learning models have achieved impres-

measuring and developing a model with low in-domain uncertainty. recently,
uncertainty estimation has emerged as an eﬀective tool for measuring the in-

discussion
in image-guided interventions, there is an urgent need for automatic assessment
of image registration quality. multi-modal registration quality evaluation poses
major challenges due to three main factors. first, dissimilar contrasts between
images require more elaborate strategies to derive relevant features for error
assessment."

regression tasks tend to be more error-prone for deep learning algorithms. to
tackle these challenges, we employed 3d focal modulation with depth-wise con-
volution to encode contextual information for the image pair. compared with the
vit and its variants, focal modulation allows a more lightweight setup, which
could be desirable for 3d data."

introduction
medical image segmentation is a core step for quantitative and precision medicine. the convolution operation
in cnn provides a strong inductive bias which is translational equivalent and efﬁ-
cient in capturing local features like boundary and texture. additionally, cnn has a local
receptive ﬁeld and are not able to capture long-range dependencies unlike transform-
ers."
/Users/yasminsarkhosh/Documents/GitHub/machine-learning-bsc-thesis-2024/miccai_2023/miccai23vol4/paper_40.pdf,"the self-attention mechanism enables learning long-
range dependencies between far-away tokens. although transformers have achieved certain success in medical imaging, the lack
of inductive bias makes them harder to be trained and requires much more training
data to avoid overﬁtting. moreover, the number of training data is also limited."
/Users/yasminsarkhosh/Documents/GitHub/machine-learning-bsc-thesis-2024/miccai_2023/miccai23vol4/paper_40.pdf,"hence in real
clinical studies and challenges, cnns can still achieve better results than transform-
ers. besides lacking
inductive bias and enough training data, one extra reason could be that transformers are
computationally much expensive and harder to tune. more improvements and empirical
evidence are needed before we say transformers are ready to replace cnns for medical
image segmentation."
