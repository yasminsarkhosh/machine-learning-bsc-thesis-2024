Transformer","then, the expected probability for the c-th class p c and the total uncertainty
u for each sample (x i ) can be calculated as p c = αc s , and u = c s ,
respectively, where s = c c=1 α c . to fit the dirichlet distribution to the
output layer of our network, we use a loss function consisting of the prediction
error l p i and the evidence adjustment where λ is the annealing coefficient to
balance the two terms.",
"WeakPolyp: You only Look Bounding Box
for Polyp Segmentation","then, this transformed mask is supervised by the bounding box annotation. this
indirect supervision avoids the misleading of box-shape bias of annotations.",x
"FLIm-Based in Vivo Classification of
Residual Cancer in the Surgical Cavity
During Transoral Robotic Surgery","therefore, in most cases, only healthy tissue in left in the cavity. to address
the technical challenge of highly imbalanced label distribution and the need for
intraoperative real-time cavity imaging, we developed an intraoperative flim
guidance model to identify residual tumors by classifying residual cancer as
anomalies.",x
"Efficient Subclass Segmentation in
Medical Images","this segmentation result is supervised by the superposition of the pseudo label
map z pse and subclass labels z, with weighting factor α: the intuition behind
this framework is to simultaneously leverage the information from both unlabeled
and labeled data by incorporating a more robust supervision from
transform-invariant pseudo labels. while mixing up only the semantic foreground
provides a way of exchanging knowledge between similar foreground objects while
lifting the confirmation bias in pseudo labeling",x
"Multi-Target Domain Adaptation with
Prompt Learning for Medical Image
Segmentation","to build the cross-age dataset, we take advantage 10 brain mris of 6-month-old
from iseg2019 the 2nd dataset is for brain tumor segmentation (enhancing tumor,
peritumoral edema and necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core), which has 285 mri
samples (210 hgg and 75 lgg). we take hgg as the source domain and lgg as the
target domain.",
"Overall Survival Time Prediction of
Glioblastoma on Preoperative MRI Using
Lesion Network Mapping","to evaluate the predictive power of the fln maps generated by our a-lnm, we
conduct extensive experiments on 235 gbm patients in the training dataset of
brats 2020 2.1 materials gsp1000 processed connectome. it publicly released
preprocessed restingstate fmri data of 1000 healthy right-handed subjects with
an average age 21.5 ± 2.9 years and approximately equal numbers of males and
females from the brain genomics superstruct project (gsp) brats 2020.",x
"Detection of Basal Cell Carcinoma in
Whole Slide Images","to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the search, we developed a new
framework named sc-net, which focuses on identifying highly valuable
architectures. we observed that conventional nas methods often overlook fairness
ranking during the search, hindering the search for optimal solutions.",
"Transfer Learning-Assisted Survival
Analysis of Breast Cancer Relying on the
Spatial Interaction Between
Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes and
Tumors","to the best of our knowledge, t2uda was the first method to successfully achieve
interrelationship transfer between tils and tumors across different cancer
subtypes for prognosis tasks. breast cancer (bc) is the most common cancer
diagnosed among females and the second leading cause of cancer death among women
after lung cancer among different types of imaging biomarkers, histopathological
images are generally considered the golden standard for bc prognosis since they
can confer important cell-level information that can reflect the aggressiveness
of bc to deal with the above challenges, several researchers began to design
domain adaption algorithms, which utilize the labeled data from a related cancer
subtype to help predict the patients' survival in the target domain.",
"DisAsymNet: Disentanglement of
Asymmetrical Abnormality on Bilateral
Mammograms Using Self-adversarial
Learning","to to alleviate the lack of annotation pixel-wise asymmetry annotations, in this
study, we propose a random synthesis method to supervise disentanglement.
training with synthetic artifacts is a low-cost but efficient way to supervise
the model to better reconstruct images the alpha weights α k is a 2d gaussian
distribution map, in which the co-variance is determined by the size of k-th
tumor t, representing the transparency of the pixels of the tumor.",
"Multi-Target Domain Adaptation with
Prompt Learning for Medical Image
Segmentation","we evaluate our proposed method on two multi-domain datasets: 1). the infant
brain mri dataset for cross-age segmentation; 2).",
"Detection of Basal Cell Carcinoma in
Whole Slide Images","we observed that conventional nas methods often overlook fairness ranking during
the search, hindering the search for optimal solutions. our sc-net framework
addresses this by ensuring fair training and precise ranking.",x
"Multi-Target Domain Adaptation with
Prompt Learning for Medical Image
Segmentation","we take hgg as the source domain and lgg as the target domain. we compared our
method with four sota methods: adda for fair comparison, we have replaced the
backbone of these models with the same we used in our approach.",
