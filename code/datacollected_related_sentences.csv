gaussian noise in the diffusion process for avoiding the introduction of details
that are not existing in pet images, and 3) designing ct-guided cross-attention
to incorporate additional ct images into the inverse process for helping the
recovery of structural details in pet.our work had three main
features/contributions: i) proposing a clinicallyapplicable unsupervised pet
enhancement framework, ii) designing three targeted strategies for improving the
