<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Image-guided surgery requires fast and accurate registration to align preoperative imaging and surgical spaces. The breast undergoes large nonrigid deformations during surgery, compromising the use of imaging data for intraoperative tumor localization. Rigid registration fails to account for nonrigid soft tissue deformations, and biomechanical modeling approaches like finite element simulations can be cumbersome in implementation and computation. We introduce regularized Kelvinlet functions, which are closed-form smoothed solutions to the partial differential equations for linear elasticity, to model breast deformations. We derive and present analytical equations to represent nonrigid point-based translation ("grab") and rotation ("twist") deformations embedded within an infinite elastic domain. Computing a displacement field using this method does not require mesh discretization or large matrix assembly and inversion conventionally associated with finite element or mesh-free methods. We solve for the optimal superposition of regularized Kelvinlet functions that achieves registration of the medical image to simulated intraoperative geometric point data of the breast. We present registration performance results using a dataset of supine MR breast imaging from healthy volunteers mimicking surgical deformations with 237 individual targets from 11 breasts. We include analysis on the method's sensitivity to regularized Kelvinlet function hyperparameters. To demonstrate application, we perform registration on a breast cancer patient case with a segmented tumor and compare performance to other image-to-physical and image-to-image registration methods. We show comparable accuracy to a previously proposed image-to-physical registration method with improved computation time, making regularized Kelvinlet functions an attractive approach for image-to-physical registration problems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Image-to-physical registration is a necessary process for computer-assisted surgery to align preoperative imaging to the intraoperative physical space of the patient to in-form surgical decision making. Most intraoperatively utilized image-to-physical regis-trations are rigid transformations calculated using fiducial landmarks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, with better computational resources and more advanced surgical field monitoring sensors, nonrigid registration techniques have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. This has made image-guided surgery more tractable for soft tissue organ systems like the liver, prostate, and breast <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This work focuses specifically on nonrigid breast registration, although these methods could be adapted for other soft tissue organs. Current guidance technologies for breast conserving surgery localize a single tumor-implanted seed without providing spatial information about the tumor boundary. As a result, resections can have several centimeters of tissue beyond the cancer margin. Despite seed information and large resections, reoperation rates are still high (~17%) emphasizing the need for additional guidance technologies such as computer-assisted surgery systems with nonrigid registration <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Intraoperative data available for registration is often sparse and subject to data collection noise. Image-to-physical registration methods that accurately model an elastic soft-tissue environment while also complying with intraoperative data constraints is an active field of research. Determining correspondences between imaging space and geometric data is required for image-to-physical registration, but it is often an inexact and ill-posed problem. Establishing point cloud correspondences using machine learning has been demonstrated on liver and prostate datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Deep learning image registration methods like VoxelMorph have also been used for this purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. However, these methods require extensive training data and may struggle with generalizability. Other non-learning image-to-physical registration strategies include <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> which utilized a corotational linear-elastic finite element method (FEM) combined with an iterative closest point algorithm. Similarly, the registration method introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> iteratively updated the image-to-physical correspondence between surface point clouds while solving for an optimal deformation state.</p><p>In addition to a correspondence algorithm, a technique for modeling a deformation field is required. Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> leverage FEM, which uses a 3D mesh to solve for unique deformation solutions. However, large deformations can cause mesh distortions with the need for remeshing. Mesh-free methods have been introduced to circumvent this limitation. The element-free Galerkin method is a mesh-free method that requires only nodal point data and uses a moving least-squares approximation to solve for a solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Other mesh-free methods are reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Although these methods do not require a 3D mesh, solving for a solution can be costly and boundary condition designation is often unintuitive. Having identified these same shortcomings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposed regularized Kelvinlet functions for volumetric digital sculpting in computer animation applications. This sculpting approach provided de-formations consistent with linear elasticity without large computational overhead.</p><p>In this work, we propose an image-to-physical registration method that uses regularized Kelvinlet functions as a novel deformation basis for nonrigid registration. Regularized Kelvinlet functions are analytical solutions to the equations for linear elasticity that we superpose to compute a nonrigid deformation field nearly instantaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>We utilize "grab" and "twist" regularized Kelvinlet functions with a linearized iterative reconstruction approach (adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) that is well-suited for sparse data registration problems. Sensitivity to regularized Kelvinlet function hyperparameters is explored on a supine MR breast imaging dataset. Finally, our approach is validated on an exemplar breast cancer case with a segmented tumor by comparing performance to previously proposed registration methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head><p>In this section, closed-form solutions to linear elastic deformation responses in an infinite medium are derived to obtain regularized Kelvinlet functions. Then, methods for constructing a superposed regularized Kelvinlet function deformation basis for achieving registration within an iterative reconstructive framework are discussed. Equation notation is written such that constants are italicized, vectors are bolded, and matrices are double-struck letters. Linear elasticity in a homogeneous, isotropic media is governed by the Navier-Cauchy equations in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), where E is Young's modulus, ν is Poisson's ratio, u(x) is the displacement vector, and F(x) is the forcing function. Analytical displacement solutions to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) that represent elastostatic states in an infinite solid can be found for specific forcing functions F(x). Equation (2) represents the forcing function for a point source F δ (x), where f is the point source forcing vector and x 0 is the load location. The closed-form displacement solution for Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) given the forcing function in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is classically known as the Kelvin state in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">3</ref>), rewritten as a function of r where r = xx 0 and r = r . The coefficients are a</p></div>

However, practical use of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">3</ref>) becomes numerically problematic in discretized problems because the displacement and displacement gradient become indefinite as x approaches x 0 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E 2(1+ν) ∇ 2 u(x) + E 2(1+ν)(1-2ν) ∇(∇ • u(x)) + F(x) = 0 (1) F δ (x) = f δ(x -x 0 ) (2) u(r) = a-b r I + b r 3 rr t f = K(r)f<label>(3)</label></formula><p>To address numerical singularity, regularization is incorporated with a new forcing function Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>), where r ε = √ r 2 + ε 2 is the regularized distance, and ε is the regularization radial scale. Solving Eq. (1) using Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) yields a formula for the first type of regularized Kelvinlet functions used in this work in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>), which is the closed-form, analytical solution for linear elastic translational ("grab") deformations.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F ε (x) = f 15ε 4 8π 1 r 7 ε (4) u ε,grab (r) = a-b r ε I + b r 3 ε rr t + a 2 ε 2 r 3 ε I f = K grab (r)f (5)</formula><p>The second type of regularized Kelvinlet functions represent "twist" deformations which are derived by expanding the previous formulation to accommodate locally affine loads instead of displacement point sources. This is accomplished by associating each component of the forcing function Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) with the directional derivative of each basis g i of the affine transformation, leading to the regularized forcing matrix in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>). An affine loading configuration consisting of pure rotational ("twist") deformation constrains F ij ε (x) to a skew-symmetric matrix that simplifies the forcing function to a cross product about a twisting force vector f in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. The pure twist displacement field response u ε,twist (r) to the forcing matrix in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) can be represented as the second type of regularized Kelvinlet functions used in this work in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p><p>Superpositions of Eq. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and Eq. ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>) are used in a registration workflow to model linear elastic deformations in the breast. These deformations are visualized on breast geometry embedded in an infinite medium with varying ε values in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">F ij ε (x) = g i • ∇f j 15ε 4 8π 1 r 7 ε (6) F ij ε × (x) = -r × f 15ε 4 8π 1 r 7 ε (7) u ε,twist (r) = a 1 r 3 ε + 3ε 2 2r 5 ε r × f = [K twist (r)] × f (8)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Registration Task</head><p>For registration, x 0 control point positions for k number of total regularized Kelvinlets "grab" and "twist" functions are distributed in a predetermined configuration. Then, the f grab and f twist vectors are optimized to solve for a displacement field that minimizes distance error between geometric data inputs. For a predetermined configuration of regularized Kelvinlet "grab" and "twist" functions centered at different x 0 control point locations, an elastically deformed state can be represented as the summation of all regularized Kelvinlet displacement fields where ∼ u (x) is the superposed displacement vector and k = k grab + k twist in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Equation ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) can be rewritten in matrix form shown in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, where α is a concatenated vector of length 3k such that α</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= [f 1 grab , f 2 grab , . . . , f k twist ]. ∼ u (x) = k grab i=1 u i ε,grab (x) + k twist i=1 u i ε,twist (x) (9) ∼ u (x) = ∼ K (x)α (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>This formulation decouples the forcing magnitudes from the Kelvinlet response matrix ∼ K (x), which is composed of column u ε,grab (x) and u ε,twist (x) vectors calculated with unit forcing vectors for each K grab (x) and K twist (x) function. This allows for linear scaling of ∼ K (x) using α. By setting x 0 locations, ε grab , and ε twist as hyperparameters, deformation states can be represented by various α vectors with the registration task being to solve for the optimal α vector.</p><p>An objective function is formulated to minimize misalignment between the moving space x moving and fixed space x fixed through geometric data constraints. For the breast imaging datasets in this work, we used simulated intraoperative data features that realistically could be collected in a surgical environment visualized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The first data feature is MR-visible skin fiducial points placed on the breast surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2,</ref><ref type="figure">red</ref>). These fiducials have known point correspondence. The other two data features are an intra-fiducial point cloud of the skin surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, light blue) and sparse contour samples of the chest wall surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, yellow). These data features are surfaces that do not have known correspondence. These data feature designations are consistent with implementations in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</p><p>For a given deformation state, each data feature contributes to the total error measure. For the point data, the error e i point for each point i is simply the distance magnitude between corresponding points in x fixed and x moving space. For the surface data, the error e i surface is calculated as the distance from every point i in the x fixed point cloud surface to the closest point in the x moving surface, projected onto the surface unit normal which allows for sliding contact between surfaces. The optimization using the objective function in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">11</ref>) includes two additions to improve the solution. The first is rigid parameters, translation τ and rotation θ, that are optimized simultaneously with the vector α. β represents the deformation state with β = [α, τ , θ ], and this compensates for rigid deformation between x fixed and x moving . The second is a strain energy regularization term e SE which penalizes deformations with large strain energy. e SE is the average strain energy density within the breast geometry, and it is computed for each β at every iteration. It is scaled by weight w SE . The optimal state β is iteratively solved using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization terminating at | (β)|&lt;10 -12 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(β) = 1 n point n point i=1 (e i point ) 2 + 1 n surface n surface i=1 (e i surface ) 2 + w SE (e SE ) 2<label>(11)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments and Results</head><p>In this section, two experiments are conducted. The first explores sensitivity to regularized Kelvinlet function hyperparameters k grab , k twist , ε grab , and ε twist and establishes optimal hyperparameters in a training dataset of 11 breast deformations. The second validates the registration method in a breast cancer patient and compares registration accuracy and computation time to previously proposed methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Hyperparameters Sensitivity Analysis</head><p>This dataset consists of supine breast MR images simulating surgical deformations of 11 breasts from 7 healthy volunteers. Volunteers (ages 23-57) were enrolled in a study approved by the Institutional Review Board at Vanderbilt University. Prior to imaging, 26 skin fiducials were distributed on the breast surface. MR images (0.391 × 0.391 × 1 mm 3 or 0.357 × 0.357 × 1 mm 3 ) were acquired with the volunteers' arms placed by their sides. This image was used as the x moving space. The volunteers were then instructed to raise one arm above their heads, causing deformation of the ipsilateral breast. A second MR image in the deformed state was acquired to create simulated intraoperative physical data and to use for validation. This second image was used as the x fixed space. The breast in x moving was segmented at the boundary between the chest wall and breast parenchyma to create a 3D model. The posterior surface was labeled to inform x 0 control point locations. The skin fiducials and intra-fiducial surface point clouds were labeled in both images as data features. Sparse tracked ultrasound data collection patterns were projected on the posterior surface for use as the third data feature. Subsurface anatomical targets were labeled in both images and used to compute target error after registration.</p><p>Three configurations were explored to test different distributions of grab and/or twist regularized Kelvinlet functions: grab functions only, twist functions only, and a combination of grab and twist functions. Grab function control points were distributed evenly on the posterior surface of the breast to approximate forces from the chest wall. Twist function control points were distributed evenly within the breast to approximate internal body forces. Three hyperparameter sweeps were used:  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Registration Methods Comparison</head><p>This dataset consists of supine breast MR images simulating surgical deformations from one breast cancer patient. A 71-year-old patient with invasive mammary carcinoma in the left breast was enrolled in a study approved by the Institutional Review Board at Vanderbilt University. Skin fiducial placement, image acquisition, arm placement, and preprocessing steps followed the same protocol detailed in Sect. 3.1. The tumor was segmented in both images by a subject matter expert, and a 3D tumor model was created to evaluate tumor overlap metrics after registration.</p><p>Regularized Kelvinlet function registration was compared to 3 other registration methods: rigid registration, an FEM-based image-to-physical registration method, and an image-to-image registration method. A point-based rigid registration using the skin fiducials provided a baseline comparator for accuracy without deformable correction. The FEM-based image-to-physical registration method, detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and implemented in breast in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, utilizes the same optimization scheme as this method but with an FEM-generated basis. k = 40 control points were used for the FEM-based registration. The image-to-image registration method was a symmetric diffeomorphic method with explicit B-spline regularization publicly available in the Advanced Normalization Toolkit (ANTs) repository <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Image-to-image registration would not be possible for intraoperative registration in most surgical settings. However, it was included to demonstrate accuracy when volumetric imaging data is available, as opposed to sparse geometric point data as in the surgical application case. The rigid and image-to-physical registrations were performed on a single thread of a 3.6 GHz AMD Ryzen 7 3700X CPU. Image-to-image registration was multithreaded on 2.3 GHz Intel Xeon (E5-4610 v2) CPUs.</p><p>Registration results for the 4 methods are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The regularized Kelvinlet method accuracy was comparable (if not slightly improved) to the FEM-based method for this example case. Runtime for the regularized Kelvinlet method was improved compared to the FEM-based method. As expected, registration without deformable correction was poor, and image-to-image registration had the best accuracy. Registered tumor geometry results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Limitations and Conclusion</head><p>Several limitations should be noted. Regularized Kelvinlet functions describe solutions that assume a physical embedding within an infinite elastic domain, which does not account for organ-specific geometry. This approach may not be well suited for problems where geometry has significant influence. This method is derived from a linear elastic model, and nonlinear models are known to better describe soft tissue mechanics. Additionally, this method assumes homogeneity and isotropy -it does not account for different tissue types and directional structures in the breast. With regards to clinical feasibility, supine MR imaging with skin fiducials is not the standard-of-care. However, using supine MR imaging for surgery is becoming increasingly investigated, and previous work demonstrated the potential of ink-based skin fiducial markings on the breast <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Despite these limitations, this method's accuracy and speed may be appropriate for surgical guidance applications.</p><p>In this work, we demonstrated the use of regularized Kelvinlet functions for imageto-physical registration of the breast. We achieved near real-time registration with comparable accuracy to previously proposed methods. We believe that this approach is generalizable to other soft-tissue organ systems and is well-suited for improving navigation during image-guided surgeries.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
