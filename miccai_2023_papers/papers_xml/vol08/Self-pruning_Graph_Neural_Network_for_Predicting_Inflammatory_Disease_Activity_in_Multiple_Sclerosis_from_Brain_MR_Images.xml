<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a severe neurological disease characterized by inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system. Hence, predicting inflammatory disease activity is crucial for disease assessment and treatment. However, MS lesions can occur throughout the brain and vary in shape, size and total count among patients. The high variance in lesion load and locations makes it challenging for machine learning methods to learn a globally effective representation of whole-brain MRI scans to assess and predict disease. Technically it is non-trivial to incorporate essential biomarkers such as lesion load or spatial proximity. Our work represents the first attempt to utilize graph neural networks (GNN) to aggregate these biomarkers for a novel global representation. We propose a two-stage MS inflammatory disease activity prediction approach. First, a 3D segmentation network detects lesions, and a self-supervised algorithm extracts their image features. Second, the detected lesions are used to build a patient graph. The lesions act as nodes in the graph and are initialized with image features extracted in the first stage. Finally, the lesions are connected based on their spatial proximity and the inflammatory disease activity prediction is formulated as a graph classification task. Furthermore, we propose a self-pruning strategy to auto-select the most critical lesions for prediction. Our proposed method outperforms the existing baseline by a large margin (AUCs of 0.67 vs. 0.61 and 0.66 vs. 0.60 for one-year and two-year inflammatory disease activity, respectively). Finally, our proposed method enjoys inherent explainability by B. Wiestler and B. Menze-Contributed equally as senior authors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a severe central nervous system disease with a highly nonlinear disease course where periodic relapses impair the patient's quality of life. Clinical studies show that relapses co-occur with the appearance of new inflammatory MS lesions in MR images <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>, making MR imaging a central element for the clinical management of MS patients. Further, assessing new MS lesions is crucial for disease assessment and therapy monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Unfortunately, prevailing therapies often involve highly active immunomodulatory drugs with potentially severe side effects. Hence, it necessitates developing machine learning models capable of predicting the future disease activity of individual patients to select the best therapy.</p><p>While recent approaches applied convolutional neural networks (CNN) to directly learn features from MR image space <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>, there remain challenges to obtain an effective global representation to characterize disease status. We attribute the difficulty of MS inflammatory disease activity prediction to a set of distinct disease characteristics that are well observable in MR images. First, while lesions have a sufficient signal-to-noise profile in images, their variation in shape, size, and number of occurrences amongst patients make it challenging for existing CNN-based methods that process the whole MRI scan in one go. Second, with advanced age, small areas appearing in the MRI of healthy individuals may resemble MS. As such, it is crucial to not only predict MS but also to identify the lesions deemed consequential for the final prediction.</p><p>To solve this problem, we use concepts from geometric deep learning. Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline. First, the lesions in the MRI scans are segmented using a state-of-the-art 3D segmentation algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and their image features are extracted with a self-supervised method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. Second, the extracted lesions are converted into a patient graph. The lesions act as nodes of the graph, while the edge connectivity is determined using the spatial proximity of the lesions. By this representation, we can solve the MS inflammatory disease activity prediction task as a graph-level classification problem. We argue that formulating the MS inflammatory disease activity prediction in our two-stage pipeline has the following advantages: (1) Graph neural networks can easily handle different numbers of nodes (lesions) and efficiently incorporate their spatial locations. (2) Modern segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref> and representation learning methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref> are effective tools for lesion detection and allow us to extract pathology-specific features. (3) By operating at the lesion level, it is possible to discover the lesions that contribute most to the eventual prediction, making the decisions more interpretable. Thus, our proposed solution can be a viable methodology for MS inflammatory disease activity prediction to handle the associated challenges. We first detect lesions in the MRI scan using nn-Unet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. A crop centered at the detection is extracted and used to learn self-supervised lesion features. Next, we build a graph from these detected lesions, where each lesion becomes a node, with the connections (edges) between lesions (nodes) defined by spatial proximity. This graph is processed using a graph neural network to generate enriched lesion features. Next, our self-pruning module (SPM) processes these enriched lesion features to determine an importance score for each lesion. The least scoring lesions are pruned-off and the highest scoring lesions are passed to the readout layer to obtain a graph-level feature vector. This graph-level vector is used for the final prediction.</p><p>Contributions. Our contribution is threefold: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> we are the first to formulate the MS inflammatory disease activity prediction task as a graph classification problem, thereby bringing a new set of methods to a significant clinical problem.</p><p>(2) We propose a two-stage pipeline that effectively captures inherent MS variations in MRI scans, thus generating an effective global representation. (3) We develop a self-pruning module, which assigns an importance score to each lesion and reduces the task complexity by prioritizing the critical lesions. Additionally, the assigned per-lesion importance score improves our model's explainability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methodology</head><p>Overview. The objective is to predict MS inflammatory disease activity, i.e., to classify if new or significantly enlarged inflammatory lesions appear in the follow-up after the initial MRI scans. We denote the dataset as D(X, y), where X is the set of lesion patches extracted from MR scans, and y ∈ {0, 1} is the inflammatory disease activity status. For patient i, multiple lesion patches {x i 1 , x i 2 , ...x i n } can exist, where n is the total number of lesions. We aim to learn a mapping function f :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">{x i 1 , x i 2 , ...x i n } → {0, 1}.</formula><p>Please note that our formulation differs from existing methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>, which aim to learn a direct mapping from the MR image to the inflammatory disease activity label. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, our proposed method consists of four distinct components. We describe each component in the following sections.</p><p>Lesion Detection and Feature Extraction. We focus on the individual lesions instead of processing whole-brain MRI scans. This is important because MS lesions typically comprise less than 1% of voxels in the MRI scan. With this strategy, the graph model can aggregate lesion-level features for an effective patient-specific representation. First, we detect the lesions using a state-of-theart nn-Unet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> pre-trained with MR images and their consensus annotations from two neuro-radiologists. Then, for each detected lesion, we extract a small fixed-size patch centered at it. Finally, we learn self-supervised features z for the lesion using a recent Transformer-based approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Lesion Graph Processor. In the second stage, we generate a patient-specific graph G(V, E, Z) from the detected lesions. The lesions act as vertices V of this graph and are initialized with the crop-derived features Z. The spatial location s of the lesions is used to determine their connectivity E using a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) graph method <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. Furthermore, the connected edges are weighted based on their spatial proximity. Specifically, given two lesions v i and v j , with spatial locations s i and s j respectively, the edge weight</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">w(v i , v j ) = exp(- si-sj 2 τ 2</formula><p>). τ is a scalar that controls the contribution of distant lesions. Hence the final graph connectivity can be represented as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E i,j = w(v i , v j ), if j ∈ N (v i ) or i ∈ N (v j ) 0, otherwise<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where N (v i ) are the nodes directly connected to the node v i . Constructing a graph from the lesions is instrumental in two aspects: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> The framework allows us to work with varying numbers of lesions in different patients. Alternatively, sequential models could be employed. However, since the lesions lack a canonical ordering, such models would not achieve an effective global representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</p><p>(2) It is possible to incorporate meaningful lesion properties such as spatial proximity and the number of lesions. Please note that separate graphs are created for individual patients. Thus, MS inflammatory disease activity prediction is formulated as a graph-level classification task. The graph G(V, E, Z) can be processed using message-passing neural networks (such as GCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, GAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, EdgeConv <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, GraphSage <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, to name a few) to learn enriched lesion features Ẑ. These enriched features are passed through to the self-pruning module.</p><p>Self-pruning Module. The number of lesions can vary substantially among the patients, including the possibility of false positives in the segmentation stage. As such, it is crucial to recognize the most relevant lesions for the final prediction. In addition, this will bring inherent explainability and make it easier for a doctor to validate model predictions. To accomplish this, the enriched lesion features Ẑ are passed through a self-pruning module (SPM). The SPM produces a binary mask M for each lesion to determine whether a lesion contributes to the classification. The SPM uses a learnable projection vector p to compute importance scores ( Ẑ p/|| p||) for the lesions. These scores are scaled with a sigmoid layer. We retain the high-scoring lesions and discard the rest, which is formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">M = top-r(σ( Ẑ p || p|| ), r)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where σ(x) = 1/(1 + e -x ) is the sigmoid function and top-r(•) is an operator which selects a fraction r of the lesions based on high importance score. r is a hyper-parameter in our setup. Since the masking process is part of the forward pass through the model during both training and inference stages and not a post hoc modification, we refer to it as self-pruning of nodes. Features of the remaining nodes ( Ẑ = Ẑ ⊗ M ) are passed to the classification head.</p><p>It should be noted that the existence of multiple lesions is a typical characteristic of MS. Hence, a crucial aspect of MS management is that clinicians must identify signs of inflammatory disease activity in MR images to make treatment decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Therefore, along with predicting inflammatory disease activity, interpreting the contribution of individual lesions to the prediction is essential. By assigning an importance score to each lesion, the SPM can provide explainability to clinicians at a lesion level, while existing CNN methods can not.</p><p>Classification Head. The classification head consists of a readout layer aggregating all the remaining node's features to produce a single feature vector ẑ for the entire graph. This graph-level feature is passed through an MLP to obtain the final prediction ŷ. We train our model using a binary cross-entropy loss.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L clf = - 1 N N i=1 (y i log( ŷi ) + (1 -y i ) log(1 -ŷi )) (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where N is the number of patients, y i is the ground truth inflammatory disease activity information and ŷi is the model prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>Datasets and Image Preprocessing. Our approach is evaluated on a cohort of 430 MS patients collected following approval from the local IRB <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Patients included in this analysis were diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS, with a maximum disease duration of three years at the time of baseline scan. We collect the FLAIR and T1w MR scans for each patient. The scans have a uniform voxel size of 1 × 1 × 1 mm 3 , were rigidly co-registered to the MNI152 atlas and skull-stripped using HD-BET <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. Three neuro-radiologists independently read longitudinal subtraction imaging, where FLAIR images from two time points were co-registered and subtracted. In this vein, new and significantly enlarged lesions are identified as positive inflammatory disease activity. The dataset contains MS inflammatory disease activity information for clinically relevant one-year and two-year intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. At the end of the first year, we have the inflammatory disease activity status of 430 patients, with 303 showing activity and 127 not. Similarly, at the end of two years, we have data available for 347 patients, with 287 showing activity and 60 not. Thus, the dataset shows a slight imbalance in favor of inflammatory disease activity. This imbalance is a typical property in the MS patients cohort that impairs algorithm development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feature Extraction and Training Configuration.</head><p>We use an nn-Unet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for lesion segmentation and detection. Then a uniform crop of size 24 × 24 × 24 mm 3 is extracted centered at each lesion. The cropped patches are passed through a transformer-based masked autoencoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> to extract self-supervised lesion features. The encoder produces a 768-dimensional feature vector for each patch. We also append normalized lesion coordinates to the encoder output to get the final lesion features.</p><p>The lesions are connected using a k-nearest neighbor algorithm with k = 5. Further, these connections (edges) are weighted using τ = 0.01 (Eq. 1). Two message-passing layers with hidden dimensions of 64 and 8, respectively, process the generated graph to enrich lesion features. Next, the enriched features are passed through the SPM. The SPM uses a learnable projection vector p ∈ R 8 and sigmoid activation to learn the importance score. Based on this importance score, a mask is produced to select r = 0.5 (i.e., 50%) of the highest-scoring lesions and discard the rest. Next, a sum aggregation is used as the readout function. These aggregated features are passed through 2 feed-forward layers with hidden dimensions of size 8. Finally, the features are passed to a sigmoid function to obtain the final prediction.</p><p>The model is trained for 300 epochs using AdamW optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> with 0.0001 weight decay. The base learning rate is 1e-4. The batch size is set to 16. A dropout layer with p = 0.5 is used between different feed-forward blocks. Since the dataset is imbalanced in favor of patients experiencing inflammatory disease activity, we use a balanced batch sampler to load approximately the same number of positive and negative samples in each mini-batch.</p><p>Evaluation Strategy, Classifier, and Metrics. We report our results on MS inflammatory disease activity prediction for the clinically relevant one and twoyear intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) is used as the evaluation metric. We use 80% of the samples as the training set and 10% as the validation. The validation set is used to select the best model which is then applied to the remaining 10% cases. This procedure is iterated until all cases have been assigned to a test set once (ten-fold cross-validation). The same folds are used for the proposed model and baseline algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>Quantitative Comparison. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the classification performance for the ten folds on one-year and two-year lesion inflammatory disease activity prediction. The ± indicates the corresponding standard deviations. We compare our method against two existing approaches for MS inflammatory disease activity prediction baselines, a 3D Res-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, and a multi-resolution CNN architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. These methods learn a direct mapping from the MR image to the inflammatory disease activity label. Our graph model outperforms the baseline methods on one (0.67 vs. 0.61 AUC) and two-year inflammatory disease activity prediction (0.66 vs. 0.60 AUC). In the following, we analyze and discuss each component of our established framework. Ablation Study. In this section, we analyze the importance of different components of our proposed method. We defer the analysis of the lesion feature representation to the appendix owing to space constraints.</p><p>The Effectiveness of Graph Structure. Since the lesion feature extractor generates rich lesion features, one may argue that the graph structure is unwarranted. There are two alternatives to using a graph, (i) completely discard the graph structure, use a feed-forward layer to enrich the lesion features further, and aggregate them to perform classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> (Since this formulation regards the input as a set, we call this Set-Proc model). (ii) Aggregate all the lesion features for a patient using a mean aggregation and process the aggregated feature by traditional machine learning algorithms such as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) with the RBF-kernel, and logistic regression (LR). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> compares our model's performance against these alternatives. Our proposed solution obtains better AUC than the alternatives, indicating that incorporating the graph structure is beneficial for eventual prediction.    The Importance of Encoding Spatial Proximity. The spatial proximity in our model is encoded at two levels. First, lesion connectivity is determined using a NN graph, and second, we weigh the edges based on their distance. Graph convolution layers such as EdgeConv, GCN, and GraphSAGE take the edge weights into account. (EdgeConv does it implicitly by taking a difference of lesion features that already contain spatial information).</p><p>On the other hand, the GAT model learns an attention weight and ignores the pre-defined edge weights. However, it still computes these coefficients on only the connected nodes. We can go further, completely ignore the distances and instead use a fully connected graph. The TransformerConv <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> on such a graph is equivalent to applying the well-known transformer encoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> on the inputs. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows that the methods that ignore spatial proximity (TransformerConv) or do not use distance-based weighting (GAT) struggle. On the other hand, EdgeConv, GCN, and GraphSAGE work better. We use GCN in our model owing to its superior performance.</p><p>The Contribution of the Self-Pruning Module (SPM). The SPM selects a subset of lesions for the final prediction during the training and evaluation phases. However, the proposed classification method can work without it. In this case, none of the lesions is discarded during the readout operation. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the classification results with and without the SPM. We observe that including SPM leads to better outcomes across different message-passing networks. An explanation could be that the SPM can better handle patient variations (in terms of the total number of lesions) by operating on a subset of lesions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Hyperparameters.</head><p>The retention ratio r and the number of neighbors k used for building the graph are the two critical hyperparameters in our proposed framework. We discuss the effect of the retention ratio r here and defer discussion about k to the appendix.</p><p>Effect of Retention Ratio r. The retention ratio r ∈ (0, 1] controls the fraction of lesions retained after the self-pruning module. If we set its value to 1, all the lesions are retained for the final prediction and thus, bypassing the self-pruning module. Any other value implies that we ignore at least a few lesions in the readout layer. Since the number of lesions can vary across graphs, we retain (N.r) lesions after the self-pruning layer. To find the optimal r, we test our model with r between 0.1 and 1.0. The results are summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. We set r to 0.5 for both tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>Predicting MS inflammatory disease activity is a clinically relevant, albeit challenging task. In this work, we propose a two-stage graph-based pipeline that surpasses existing CNN-based methods by decoupling the tasks of detecting and learning rich semantic features for lesions. We also propose a self-pruning module that further improves model generalizability by handling variations in the number of lesions within patients. Most importantly, we frame the MS inflammatory disease activity prediction as a graph classification problem. We hope our work provides a new perspective and leads to cutting-edge research at the intersection of graph processing and MS inflammatory disease activity prediction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

Next, our self-pruning module (SPM) processes these enriched lesion features to determine an importance score for each lesion. The least scoring lesions are pruned-off and the highest scoring lesions are passed to the readout layer to obtain a graph-level feature vector. This graph-level vector is used for the final prediction.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,41,79,53,72,340,21,73,99" type="bitmap" /></figure>
