<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Surface-based analysis methods for functional imaging data have been shown to offer substantial benefits for the study of the human cortex, namely in the localisation of functional areas and the establishment of inter-subject correspondence. A new approach for surface-based parameter estimation via non-linear model fitting on functional timeseries data is presented. It treats the different anatomies within the brain in the manner that is most appropriate: surface-based for the cortex, volumetric for white matter, and using regions-of-interest for subcortical grey matter structures. The mapping between these different domains is incorporated using a novel algorithm that accounts for partial volume effects. A variational Bayesian framework is used to perform parameter inference in all anatomies simultaneously rather than separately. This approach, called hybrid inference, has been implemented using stochastic optimisation techniques. A comparison against a conventional volumetric workflow with post-projection on simulated perfusion data reveals improvements parameter recovery, preservation of spatial detail and consistency between spatial resolutions. At 4 mm isotropic resolution, the following improvements were obtained: 2.7% in SSD error of perfusion, 16% in SSD error of Z-score perfusion, and 27% in Bhattacharyya distance of perfusion distribution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, there has been increasing interest in performing surface-based analysis of magnetic resonance neuroimaging (MRI) data in the human cortex. A basic assumption that underpins this approach is that cortical activity will correlate better according to geodesic distance (along the surface) than geometric distance (straight-line). The benefits include improvements in the localisation of functional areas and the establishment of inter-subject correspondence <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Due to the fact that MRI data is typically acquired on a 3D voxel grid that does not directly correspond with a 2D surface, a necessary pre-processing step is to project the volumetric data onto the cortical surface, a complex operation for which there is no commonly-agreed upon solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Of particular relevance is the partial volume effect (PVE): because functional imaging voxels are of comparable size to the thickness of the human cortex, each is likely to contain a mixture of cortical grey matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This mixing of signals from different tissues introduces confound into later analysis steps. Furthermore, because not all anatomies in the brain are amenable to surface analysis, data for the subcortex is usually processed in a volumetric manner. This leads to separate workflows for the different anatomies within the brain, as exemplified by the Human Connectome Project's (HCP) parallel fMRISurface and fMRIVolume pipelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The objective of this work was to develop a framework for parameter inference that is able to operate in a surface and volumetric manner simultaneously. This would remove the need for separate workflows whilst ensuring that each anatomy of interest is treated in an optimal manner, namely surface-based for the cortex, volumetric for WM, and region-of-interest (ROI) for subcortical GM structures. This principle corresponds directly with the HCP's concept of grayordinates <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In order to achieve this, a novel algorithm that maps data between different representations has been embedded within a modality-specific generative model. Via the use variational Bayesian techniques, it is then possible to perform non-linear model-fitting directly on volumetric timeseries data without pre-processing. The advantages of this approach are demonstrated on simulated perfusion MRI data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head><p>Theory. The spatial locations within the brain at which parameter estimates are obtained are hereafter called nodes. A key step in performing inference is to define a mapping between nodes and the voxel data that has been acquired, which is then embedded within a generative model to yield a function that relates physiological parameters to the data they reconstruct. In the case of volumetric inference, this mapping is one-to-one: each node corresponds to exactly one voxel. The concept can be extended to include other types of node: alongside voxels for WM, surface vertices can represent the cortex and volumetric ROIs can represent subcortical GM structures. Collectively these are referred to as hybrid nodes, which correspond to greyordinates in the HCP terminology <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. An illustration is given in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>In this work, the mapping for hybrid nodes previously introduced in [10] was used. It is constructed by calculating the volume of intersection between individual voxels and the geometric primitives that construct the cortical ribbon, WM tracts, or individual ROIs. Importantly, because each node corresponds by definition to exactly one tissue type, the mapping will be many-to-one in voxels that contain multiple tissues which is an explicit representation of PVE. The mapping takes the form of a non-square sparse matrix (number of nodes &gt; voxels), an example of which is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Having defined and embedded the mapping within a generative model, one can turn to the process of parameter inference. We adopt a Bayesian approach because this permits the incorporation of prior knowledge and the quantification of parameter uncertainty. Both attributes are valuable given the challenging signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of functional imaging data. Under this approach, the objective is to obtain a posterior distribution p for the parameters θ of a generative model M given observed data y, which may be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (θ|y, M ) = P (y|θ, M )P (θ|M ) P (y|M )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The choice of model M and corresponding physiological parameters θ is determined by the imaging modality in question. In practice, evaluating this expression for all but the most trivial configurations is infeasible due to the integrations entailed (notably the evidence term in the denominator). A number of numerical approaches have thus been developed, one of which is variational Bayes (VB) which approximates the posterior p with an arbitrary distribution q and uses the free energy F to assess the accuracy of approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Omitting M from notation, F is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F (θ) = q(θ) log p(y|θ) p(θ) q(θ) dθ (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>VB thus turns parameter inference into an optimisation problem: what q best approximates p as measured by the free energy? One means of implementing this is to use stochastic optimisation techniques. A Monte Carlo approximation to the objective function F may be obtained using an average over L randomly drawn samples θ * l from q(θ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">F ≈ 1 L L l log(p(y|θ * l )) -log q(θ * l ) p(θ * l )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>This strategy is referred to as stochastic variational Bayes (SVB). By constructing this expression as a computational graph, including the modalityspecific generative model M with its embedded mapping from hybrid nodes to voxels, automatic differentiation techniques may be used to maximise F and thus derive the optimal approximation q to the true posterior p. The volumetric implementation of SVB previously introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> has been extended in this manner and the end result is referred to as hybrid SVB, hSVB. Note that this approach does not involve any learning or training: on each dataset, the inference starts afresh and operates on all data until approximate convergence of the optimisation problem has been reached.</p><p>A key advantage of the Bayesian approach is that it enables prior information to be incorporated into the inference. Such priors can either be distributional, for example an empirically-derived normal distribution; or spatial, which encode the belief that parameter values should correlate in adjacent regions of the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. A spatial prior is particularly useful as a means of mitigating the low SNR inherent to many functional imaging techniques because it applies regularisation in a principled manner that is determined solely by data quality as opposed to relying on user-set parameters. When applied to volumetric data, a drawback of the spatial prior is that it is unaware of underlying anatomy, and in particular PVE. This is because it is typically implemented using an isotropic Laplacian operator over the first-order neighbourhood of voxels, which is especially problematic at the cortical boundary where it will enforce a similarity constraint across the GM/WM boundary even though these tissues may have different parameter values. Under a hybrid approach, it is possible to restrict the spatial prior to operate only in anatomically contiguous regions. Specifically, one spatial prior is defined on the surface for the cortex, a second spatial prior is defined in the volume for non-cortical tissue, and hence regularisation no longer happens across tissue boundaries. In this work, the isotropic Laplacian on firstorder neighbours was used for the volumetric prior, and the discrete cotangent Laplacian was used for the surface prior <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Evaluation. hSVB was evaluated using simulated mutli-delay arterial spin labelling (ASL) data, a perfusion modality which is sensitive to both cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial transit time (ATT). Inference on multi-delay ASL data requires fitting a non-linear model with two parameters which is more challenging than for single-delay ASL. A single subject's T1 MPRAGE anatomical image (1.5 mm isotropic resolution, TR 1.9 s, TE 3.74 ms, flip angle 8 • ) was processed to extract the left cortical hemisphere, which defined the ground truth anatomy from which ASL data was simulated. FreeSurfer was used to obtain mesh reconstructions of the white and pial cortical surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>; FSL FIRST was used to segment subcortcial GM structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>; FSL FAST was used to segment cerebrospinal fluid <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>; and finally Toblerone <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> was used to obtain WM PV estimates.</p><p>A single-compartment well-mixed ASL model was used to represent term M in Eq. 1 and simulate data <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Pseudo-continuous ASL with six post-label delays of [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5] s and 1.8 s label duration was used. For the cortex, a ground truth CBF map with a mean value of 60 units and sinusoidal variation of 40 units peak-to-peak was used, illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, and a constant ATT of 1.1 s was used. In WM and subcortical GM structures, constant reference CBF and ATT values were assumed. Data was simulated at spatial resolutions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> mm isotropic and SNR levels of x • 2 n , n ∈ [-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1], i.e., from x/2 to 2x, where x represents typical SNR estimated from a single subject's mutli-delay data acquired in a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In the results, the value x is omitted from notation, so SNR = 2 0 means 'typical SNR'. This variety of resolutions and SNR levels reflects the diversity of acquisitions seen in clinical practice. In all cases, zero-mean additive white noise was used.</p><p>hSVB has been implemented using TensorFlow version 2.9 running on Python 3.9.12. Optimisation was performed using RMSProp with a learning rate of 0.1, a decay factor of 0.97, and a sample size of 10. During training, a reversion to previous best state ('mean reversion') was performed when cost did not improve for 50 consecutive epochs; for all experiments, training was run until 20 such reversions had taken place which served as a proxy for convergence. Typically this implied training for around 2000 epochs. A folded normal distribution was used on all model parameters to restrict inference to positive values only. Runtime on a 6 core CPU was around 5 mins per inference, using around 4 GB of RAM.</p><p>The comparator method was based on BASIL, a conventional volumetric ASL processing workflow <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Specifically, the oxford_asl pipeline with partial volume effect correction was run using the same PV estimates from which the ASL data was simulated, and then the GM-specific parameter maps were projected onto the cortical surface using the same method as embedded within hSVB <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This method is referred to as BASIL-projected, BP. Runtime (single-threaded) was around 5 min per inference, using around 1 GB of RAM.</p><p>Performance was assessed by calculating the following metrics with respect to the ground truth cortical CBF map: sum of squared differences (SSD) of CBF; SSD of Z-transformed CBF, and Bhattacharyya distance of CBF distribution. The second and third metrics are included because they are sensitive to relative perfusion, whereas the first is sensitive to absolute CBF. A receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed using a binary classifier of varying threshold value t. Recalling that the ground truth CBF map had a mean value of 60 with extrema of ±20, t was set at values of 5 to 15 with an increment of 1. At each t, areas of hypoperfusion were classified with a threshold value of 60 -t and hyperperfusion with 60 + t. The area-under ROC (AUROC) for hypo and hyperperfusion was then calculated and the mean of the two taken. This yielded an AUROC score for each method at varying levels of threshold t. </p></div>

For all SNR, hSVB's map retained more contrast than BP's: the bright spots were brighter, and vice-versa, particularly so at low SNR. At SNR = 2 -1 , BP's result displayed a positive bias in CBF which was readily observed by comparison to other SNR levels. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> shows SSD in CBF, SSD in Z-transformed CBF, and Bhattacharyya distance of CBF perfusion distribution, all for the cortex. For SSD, hSVB performed worse than BP at low SNR, and better for SNR ≥ 2 0 . By contrast, for SSD of Z-transformed CBF, hSVB performed better at almost all SNR. In Bhattacharyya distance, hSVB performed better at all voxel sizes and SNR. Of note in all panels was the consistency of hSVB's results across voxel sizes, whereas BP displayed greater variation (particularly for SSD of Z-transformed CBF, where the 2 mm result was substantially better than all others).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>The results presented here demonstrate that a hybrid approach to parameter inference using SVB (hSVB) offers a compelling alternative for the surface-based analysis of functional neuroimaging data. hSVB can operate directly on volumetric data without pre-processing and is able to able to apply the spatial prior in an anatomically-informed manner that respects tissue boundaries.</p><p>Applied to simulated ASL data, hSVB demonstrated a number of positive attributes in relation to a conventional volumetric workflow with post-projection (BP). Firstly, greater consistency in performance across voxel sizes was observed. As spatial resolution directly determines the extent of PVE within data, this implied that hSVB is more robust to PVE which is an important source of confound. Secondly, at higher levels of SNR, hSVB was able to deliver estimates that scored substantially better across a variety of metrics, which suggests it is well-placed to exploit future increases in SNR that result from advances in hardware and acquisition. Finally, hSVB was better able to discern relative perfusion differences, i.e., areas of abnormality. The trade-off for this was higher SSD errors in absolute perfusion values at low SNR.</p><p>A key point of divergence between hSVB and BP observed in this work was in the effect of the spatial prior at low SNR levels. Bayesian inference can be understood as an updating process whereby the prior distribution is modified to the extent that the observed data supports this. For low SNR data, the data will support less deviation from the priors. Referring to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, BP tended towards globally homogenous solutions with high smoothing and low detail, whereas hSVB did the opposite: increasingly heterogenous ('textured', in the language of image analysis) solutions with low smoothing and high detail. In this scenario, the SSD of CBF metric is asymmetric: as smoothing increases towards a perfectly homogenous solution, SSD will approach a finite asymptotic value, whereas in the opposite outcome of increasingly extreme minima and maxima that preserve overall detail, SSD will increase towards infinity. It is believed that this mechanism explains the high SSD errors obtained by hSVB at low SNR, and also explains why hSVB performed much better on a relative basis (SSD of Z-score CBF), where the ability to distinguish perfusion variation matters more than the absolute values.</p><p>Two limitations of this work are that the ground truth cortical CBF map used to simulate data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) is clearly highly contrived, and the simulation did not include any of the imperfections normally seen in acquisition data, such as motion, intensity or geometric distortion artefacts. Though such problems are normally dealt with prior to performing inference via separate pre-processing operations, they can rarely be fully corrected, and thus some residual artefact may remain during inference which may degrade performance. The next step in the development of this work will be to try hSVB on human acquisition data to verify similar performance to the results presented here, which is currently in progress.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .Fig. 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
