<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Most diffusion biophysical models capture basic properties of tissue microstructure, such as diffusivity and anisotropy. More realistic models that relate the diffusion-weighted signal to cell size and membrane permeability often require simplifying assumptions such as short gradient pulse and Gaussian phase distribution, leading to tissue features that are not necessarily quantitative. Here, we propose a method to quantify tissue microstructure without jeopardizing accuracy owing to unrealistic assumptions. Our method utilizes realistic signals simulated from the geometries of cellular microenvironments as fingerprints, which are then employed in a spherical mean estimation framework to disentangle the effects of orientation dispersion from microscopic tissue properties. We demonstrate the efficacy of microstructure fingerprinting in estimating intra-cellular, extra-cellular, and intra-soma volume fractions as well as axon radius, soma radius, and membrane permeability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In diffusion MRI, biophysical models offer a non-invasive means of probing the tissue micro-architecture of the human brain. Most models rely on closed-form formulas derived with simplifying assumptions such as short gradient pulse, Gaussian phase distribution, and the absence of compartmental exchange. The reliability and interpretability of these models diminish with deviation from these assumptions.</p><p>Monte Carlo (MC) simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> and solving the Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation (BT-PDE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> are common methods for generating realistic signals associated with different gradient profiles and cellular geometries. However, the applications of these simulation techniques have been mostly limited to the validation of diffusion models rather than the estimation of microstructural properties.</p><p>Microstructure fingerprinting (MF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> exploits the representation accuracy and physical interpretability of simulated models to quantify microstructural properties. Diffusion signals are first simulated for a large collection of microstructural geometries, giving "fingerprints" of, for example, axons, somas, and the extra-cellular matrix. Tissue properties are inferred based on the relative contribution of each fingerprint to the voxel signal.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce a novel MF technique with the following key features:</p><p>1. MC simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> is computationally expensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, limiting its ability in constructing a sufficient large dictionary of fingerprints for accurate tissue quantification. We will use SpinDoctor <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to simulate diffusion signal by solving the BT-PDE. The significant speed-up of SpinDoctor over MC simulations allows fast construction of a comprehensive dictionary of fingerprints. 2. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, we will include fingerprints associated with different levels of membrane permeability to account for inter-cellular exchange. The utilization of simulated models has been shown to remove estimation bias associated with short exchange times <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and to yield marked improvement and higher reproducibility over the widely used Kärger model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. 3. Spherical Mean Spectrum Imaging (SMSI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> is used to eliminate confounding factors such as extra-axonal water and axonal orientation dispersion to improve sensitivity of the diffusion-weighted signal to axon radii <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. 4. MR-derived statistics are often biased toward large axons due to their dominant signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. We introduce a method to correct for this bias based on signal fingerprints, offering radius and permeability measurements that are more biologically realistic.</p><p>Our method is able to efficiently and accurately probe microstructural properties such as cell size and membrane permeability without relying on assumptions associated with closed-form formulas.</p></div>

For brevity, we omit P as it is the same for all i's. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, J i is based on a tensor model defined by longitudinal diffusivity λ [i] and radial diffusivity λ ⊥ [i], yielding only basic tissue properties such as diffusivity or anisotropy. Inferring geometrical properties such as the radius from diffusivity is not straight-forward <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. To effectively quantify cell size and membrane permeability, we use Spin-Doctor <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> to generate realistic signal fingerprints for various microstructural geometries (called 'atoms') representing axons and somas with a range of radii and different levels of permeability in an extra-cellular matrix.

Our parallelized implementation generates a dictionary of fingerprints for Human Connectome Project (HCP) data with 48 intra-axonal fingerprints (6 radii and 8 permeabilities) and 20 intra-soma (20 radii) in 5 min.

There is an empirical lower bound on the soma radius that can be detected via a mixture of somas (isotropic) and axons (anisotropic) when using the mean signal alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. By using the full gradient-sensitized signal in Step 1, our method can distinguish between soma (isotropic signal) and axon (anisotropic signal). Our approach with both FS and MS allows for modeling a spectrum of diffusion from fine to coarse scales without fixing the number of compartments, e.g., one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, two (intra-cellular and extra-cellular) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, or three (intra-cellular, extra-cellular, and free-water) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Radius Bias Correction</head><p>The average axon radius for each voxel can be calculated by averaging the radii of the respective fingerprints, weighted by the volume fractions. Since the volume fractions ν are estimated from the normalized signal model <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, they are actually 'signal fractions'. Weighted averaging using signal fractions yields the axon radius index <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Since each axon's contribution to the voxel signal is approximately proportional to the square of its radius <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, using the signal fraction will create a bias toward axons with large radius <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This explains why the radius index is often in the range of 3 to 6 µm <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> while most axons have actual radii of 0.05 to 1.5 µm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. We correct for this bias by examining the microstructure model and the actual signal.

MF-SMSI estimates accurately the volume fraction of each compartment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Cell Size and Membrane Permeability</head><p>To investigate the efficacy of our bias correction, we performed three experiments:</p><p>1. Axonal radius -We simulated signals for two impermeable axons with radii 2 µm and 4 µm, each with volume fraction 0.5. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (left panel), the axon radius is biased toward the axon with higher baseline signal, giving a large average radius, similar to the observation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Our unbiased estimate of the radius is markedly closer to the ground truth of 3 µm. 2. Membrane permeability -We simulated the signals for two axons with permeabilities 4 and 6 (×1 × 10 -6 µm µs -1 ), common radius 3 µm, and equal volume fraction 0.5. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (middle panel), the biased permeability estimate is biased toward the axon with lower permeability and therefore higher baseline signal. MF-SMSI is able to estimate the correct permeability value matching the ground truth of 5 × 1 × 10 -6 µm µs -1 . 3. Soma radius -We simulated signals for two somas with radii 4 µm and 6 µm with equal volume fraction 0.5. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (right panel), the bias toward the soma with higher radius (higher baseline signal) is not severe. MF-SMSI yields estimate of the soma radius that is closer to the ground truth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">In-vivo Data</head><p>We compare our estimates with the axonal radius index r index axon from ActiveAx <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.

Axonal radii are slightly lower in the anterior than the posterior part of the brain, in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. ActiveAx r index axon is overestimated with values ranging from 3.5 to 7 µm with abrupt spatial changes: almost doubled from the corpus callosum to the cortex, which is unrealistic as the spatial variation of axonal radii was reported to be small <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</p><p>The soma radii r soma in the cortical ribbon have a mean value of 11 µm, similar to what was reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. </p></div>

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>(a) shows the mean axonal radii estimated with MF-SMSI and ActiveAx for different areas of the corpus callosum from HCP subjects. Overall, there is a low-high-low trend going from the genu (anterior) through the midbody to the splenium (posterior) of the corpus callosum. Ex-vivo values (after shrinkage correction) fall almost entirely in the range calculated with MF-SMSI, indicating strong agreement between our results and histological measurements.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>(b) shows the distribution of mean axonal radius in the corpus callosum from MF-SMSI, ActiveAx, and r eff from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.
