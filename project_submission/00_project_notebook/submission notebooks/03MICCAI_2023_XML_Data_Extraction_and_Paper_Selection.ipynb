    "### Objective of the Notebook:\n",
    "The notebook is designed for preprocessing and extracting structured information from a collection of MICCAI 2023 XML documents. This involves transforming the raw XML data into clean, organized formats suitable for analysis and further processing. Key operations include parsing XML for headers and related text, identifying specific content like cancer-related papers, and extracting meaningful insights through structured dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Data Expected:\n",
    "The input for this notebook includes:\n",
    "- XML documents from MICCAI 2023, located at a predefined directory on the user's system.\n",
    "- These XML documents should already be formatted correctly and accessible to the script for reading and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Data/Files Generated:\n",
    "Outputs generated by this notebook include:\n",
    "- Structured CSV files or dataframes containing parsed and cleaned information from the XML documents.\n",
    "- A CSV file specifically aggregating cancer-related papers extracted from the XML data.\n",
    "- Various CSV files based on further refined categorizations (like patient mentions in the cancer-related papers).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions or Important Notes:\n",
    "- The GROBID client must be running on the local machine via terminal to process the documents. This client is essential for extracting text from the XML documents.\n",
    "- XML documents are expected to follow a consistent structure that allows for automated parsing by the script.\n",
    "- Manual interventions were necessary for file renaming based on titles extracted from XML, implying the script assumes that each document can be uniquely identified by its title.\n",
    "- The script assumes the presence of specific headers and textual formats within the XML files for accurate parsing.\n",
    "- Error handling is minimal, so XML files should not contain corrupt data or unexpected formatting errors."
