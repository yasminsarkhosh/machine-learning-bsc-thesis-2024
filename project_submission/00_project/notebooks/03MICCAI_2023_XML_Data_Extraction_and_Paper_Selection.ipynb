    "#### **Objective of the Notebook:**\n",
    "***\n",
    "This notebook preprocesses and analyzes XML documents from the MICCAI 2023 conference with the aim to:\n",
    "- **Extract Structured Information:** Transform raw XML data into a clean, organized format for detailed analysis.\n",
    "- **Identify Key Content:** Extract headers, titles, and related text from XML documents.\n",
    "- **Focus on Specific Research:** Identify and extract papers related to cancer topics.\n",
    "- **Data Aggregation:** Aggregate data into structured dataframes to facilitate further analysis and insights extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Data Expected:\n",
    "- **XML Documents:** Properly formatted XML documents from MICCAI 2023 stored in a predefined directory on the user's system, accessible to the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output Data/Files Generated:\n",
    "- [Access all outputs](00MICCAI_total_outputs/03MICCAI_all_outputs)\n",
    "- **Structured Data CSV:** `03MICCAI_notebook_df_paper_extractions_all_cleaned_.csv` containing parsed and cleaned information.\n",
    "- **Cancer-Related CSV:** `03MICCAI_notebook_df_paper_extractions_cancer.csv` aggregating information from cancer-related papers.\n",
    "- **Refined Categorization CSVs:** Files like `03MICCAI_notebook_df_paper_extractions_patients_and_cancer.csv` based on refined categorizations, such as mentions of patients in cancer-related papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions or Important Notes:\n",
    "- **GROBID Client Requirement:** A running instance of the GROBID client on the local machine is crucial for processing XML documents.\n",
    "- **Document Structure:** Assumes XML documents adhere to a consistent structure suitable for automated parsing.\n",
    "- **File Renaming:** Includes functionality to rename files based on titles extracted from XML, indicating each document can be uniquely identified by its title.\n",
    "- **Expected Headers and Formats:** Specific headers and textual formats are anticipated within the XML files for accurate parsing.\n",
    "- **Error Handling:** Minimal error handling suggests XML files should not contain corrupt data or unexpected formatting errors.\n"
