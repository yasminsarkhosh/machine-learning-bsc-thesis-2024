Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"in an algorithm used to predict healthcare costs, black patients who received
the same health risk scores as white patients were consistently sicker [21]."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"systemic bias poses a
greater threat to ai model's applications, as these biases can be baked right
into the model's decision process [22].pulmonary embolism (pe) is an example of
health disparities related to race."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"black patients exhibit a 50% higher
age-standardized pe fatality rate and a twofold risk for pe hospitalization than
white patients [18,24]."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"hospitalized black patients with pe were younger than
whites."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"racial disparities exist
in pe and demonstrate the inequities that affect black patients."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"we will first introduce our pulmonary embolism multimodal
datasets, including survival and race labels."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"for each patient, the race labels, survival time-to-event labels and
pesi variables are collected from clinical data, and the 11 pesi variables are
used to calculate the pesi scores, which include age, sex, comorbid illnesses
(cancer, heart failure, chronic lung disease), pulse, systolic blood pressure,
respiratory rate, temperature, altered mental status, and arterial oxygen
saturation at the time of diagnosis [2].diverse bias of multimodal survival
prediction model."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"this
redundancy leads to model overfitting on race, compromising the fairness of risk
prediction across different races."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"besides, clinical data in the form of text
reports and pesi variables objectively reflect the patient's physiological
information and the physician's diagnosis, exhibiting smaller race biases in
correlation with survival across different races."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"in
general, our framework including de-biased sp modules shows significantly better
predictions in testing set than the pesi-based outcome estimation with c-indexes
of 0.669, 0.654, 0.697, 0.043 for the overall testset, white testset, color
testset and race bias."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"the de-biased results outperform the baseline in overall
survival c-index and show a lower race bias, especially in imaging-and
fusion-based predictions."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"the results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed
de-biasing in mitigating race inequity."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"the results also prove the observations
for the different biases present in different modalities, especially in the ctpa
images containing more abundant race-related information."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"the disentangled
representations, transformed from latent space to a 2d plane via tsne and
color-coded by race [9], are shown in fig."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"we observe the disentanglement in
the visualization of the id features z id , while the survival features z sur
eliminate the race bias."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"the lack of apparent race bias observed in both the
original features and those encoded in the baseline can be attributed to the
subordinate role that id features play in the multimodal information."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"in addition, the predictions of
the de-biased framework show favorable performance, and our multimodal fusion
demonstrates a more pronounced discriminative ability in the k-m survival
analysis compared to the single-modal results.we conducted ablation studies to
examine the effect of the two key components, including swapping feature
augmentation and race-balance resampling."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"in this work, we developed a de-biased survival prediction framework based on
the race-disentangled representation."
