EdgeMixup: Embarrassingly Simple Data Alteration to Improve Lyme Disease Lesion Segmentation and Diagnosis Fairness,"medical image analysis has greatly benefited from advances in ai [1] yet some
improvements still remain to be addressed, importantly in areas that allow both
algorithmic performance and fairness [2], and in certain medical applications
that promise to significantly lessen morbidity and mortality."
EdgeMixup: Embarrassingly Simple Data Alteration to Improve Lyme Disease Lesion Segmentation and Diagnosis Fairness,"therefore, existing skin disease segmentation [13] as
well as existing general segmentation works, such as u-net [14], polar training
[15], vit-adapter [16], and mfsnet [17], usually suffer from relatively low
performance and reduced fairness [2,18,19].in this paper, we present the first
lyme disease dataset that contains labeled segmentation and skin tones."

dataset with manual labels is available at this url [20].secondly, we design a
simple yet novel data preprocessing and alternation method, called edgemixup, to
improve lyme disease segmentation and diagnosis fairness on samples with
different skin-tones."

Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"bias in medicine has demonstrated a notable challenge for providing
comprehensive and equitable care."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"implicit biases can negatively affect patient
care, particularly for marginalized populations with lower socioeconomic status
[30]."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"evidence has demonstrated that implicit biases in healthcare providers
could contribute to exacerbating these healthcare inequalities and create a more
unfair system for people of lower socioeconomic status [30]."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"based on the data
with racial bias, the unfairness presents in developing evaluative algorithms."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"along these advancements, bias in
healthcare and ai are exposing poignant gaps in the field's understanding of
model implementation and their utility [25,26]."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"ai model quality relies on input
data and addressing bias is a crucial research area."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"systemic bias poses a
greater threat to ai model's applications, as these biases can be baked right
into the model's decision process [22].pulmonary embolism (pe) is an example of
health disparities related to race."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"survival
analysis is often used in pe to assess how survival is affected by different
variables, using a statistical method like kaplan-meier method and cox
proportional-hazards regression model [7,12,14].however, one issue with
traditional survival analysis is bias from single modal data that gets
compounded when curating multimodal datasets, as different combinations of modes
and datasets create with a unified structure."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"multimodal data sets are useful
for fair ai model development as the bias complementary from different sources
can make de-biased decisions and assessments."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"in that process, the biases of
each individual data set will get pooled together, creating a multimodal data
set that inherits multiple biases, such as racial bias [1,15,23]."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"in addition,
it has been found that creating multimodal datasets without any debiasing
techniques does not improve performance significantly and does increase bias and
reduce fairness [5]."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"overall, a holistic approach to model development would be
beneficial in reducing bias aggregation in multimodal datasets."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"in recent years,
disentangled representation learning (drl) [4] for bias disentanglement improves
model generalization for fairness [3,6,27].we developed a pe outcome model that
predicted mortality and detected bias in the output."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"we then implemented methods
to remove racial bias in our dataset and model and output unbiased pe outcomes
as a result."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"our contributions are as follows: (1) we identified bias diversity
in multimodal information using a survival prediction fusion framework."

proposed a de-biased survival prediction framework with demographic bias
disentanglement."

unbiased features."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"this section describes the detail of how we identify the varying degrees of bias
in multimodal information and illustrates bias using the relative difference in
survival outcomes."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"for each patient, the race labels, survival time-to-event labels and
pesi variables are collected from clinical data, and the 11 pesi variables are
used to calculate the pesi scores, which include age, sex, comorbid illnesses
(cancer, heart failure, chronic lung disease), pulse, systolic blood pressure,
respiratory rate, temperature, altered mental status, and arterial oxygen
saturation at the time of diagnosis [2].diverse bias of multimodal survival
prediction model."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"this
redundancy leads to model overfitting on race, compromising the fairness of risk
prediction across different races."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"besides, clinical data in the form of text
reports and pesi variables objectively reflect the patient's physiological
information and the physician's diagnosis, exhibiting smaller race biases in
correlation with survival across different races."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"in
general, our framework including de-biased sp modules shows significantly better
predictions in testing set than the pesi-based outcome estimation with c-indexes
of 0.669, 0.654, 0.697, 0.043 for the overall testset, white testset, color
testset and race bias."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"the de-biased results outperform the baseline in overall
survival c-index and show a lower race bias, especially in imaging-and
fusion-based predictions."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"the results also prove the observations
for the different biases present in different modalities, especially in the ctpa
images containing more abundant race-related information."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"we observe the disentanglement in
the visualization of the id features z id , while the survival features z sur
eliminate the race bias."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"the lack of apparent race bias observed in both the
original features and those encoded in the baseline can be attributed to the
subordinate role that id features play in the multimodal information."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"the swapping augmentation provides a strong bias
correction effect for image data with obvious bias."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"we detected indications of racial bias in our dataset and
conducted an analysis of the multimodal diversity."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"experimental results
illustrate that our approach is effective for eliminating racial bias while
resulting in an overall improved model performance."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"the proposed technique is
clinically relevant as it can address the pervasive presence of racial bias in
healthcare systems and offer a solution for minimizing or eliminating bias
without pausing to evaluate their affection for the models and tools."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"our study
is significant as it highlights and evaluates the negative impact of racial bias
on deep learning models."
Improving Outcome Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism by De-biased Multi-modality Model,"the research in our paper demonstrates and proves that eliminating
racial biases from data improves performance, and yields a more precise and
robust survival prediction tool."
