<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the recent literature, development of foundational models has been the main driving force in artificial intelligence, for example, large language models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref> trained with either autoregressive prediction or masked token inpainting, and computer vision models <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref> trained by contrasting visuallanguage features. In contrast, development in the biomedical domain lags far behind due to limitations of data availability from two aspects, (i) the expertise required for annotation, (ii) privacy concerns. This paper presents our preliminary study for constructing a large-scale, high-quality, image-text biomedical dataset using publicly available scientific papers, with minimal manual efforts involved.</p><p>In particular, we crawl figures and corresponding captions from scientific documents on PubMed Central, which is a free full-text archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (NIH/NLM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. This brings two benefits: (i) the contents in publications are generally well-annotated and examined by experts, (ii) the figures have been well-anonymized and de-identified. In the literature, we are clearly not the first to construct biomedical datasets in such manner, however, existing datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref> suffer from certain limitations in diversity or scale from today's standard. For example, as a pioneering work, ROCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> was constructed long time ago with only 81k radiology images. MedICAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> contains 217k images, but are mostly consisted of compound figures.</p><p>In this work, we tackle the above-mentioned limitations by introducing an automatic pipeline to generate dataset with subfigure-subcaption correspondence from scientific documents, including three major stages: medical figure collection, subfigure separation, subcaption separation &amp; alignment. The final dataset, PMC-OA, consisting of 1.65M image-text pairs (not including samples from ROCO), covers a wide scope of diagnostic procedures and diseases, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Along with the constructed dataset, we train a CLIP-style vision-language model for the biomedical domain, termed as PMC-CLIP. To achieve such a goal, the model is trained on PMC-OA with standard image-text contrastive (ITC) loss, and to encourage the joint interaction of image and text, masked language modeling (MLM) is also applied. We evaluate the pre-trained model on several downstream tasks, including medical image-text retrieval, medical image classification, and medical visual question answering (VQA). PMC-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks, surpassing previous methods significantly.</p><p>Overall, in this paper, we make the following contributions: First, we propose an automatic pipeline to construct high-quality image-text biomedical datasets from scientific papers, and construct an image-caption dataset via the proposed pipeline, named PMC-OA, which is 8× larger than before. With the proposed pipeline, the dataset can be continuously updated. Second, we pre-train a vision-language model on the constructed image-caption dataset, termed as PMC-CLIP, to serve as a foundation model for biomedical domain. Third, we conduct thorough experiments on various downstream tasks (retrieval, classification, and VQA), and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The dataset and pre-trained model will be made available to the community. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The PMC-OA Dataset</head><p>In this section, we start by describing the dataset collection procedure in Sect. 2.1, followed by a brief overview of PMC-OA in Sect. 2.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Dataset Collection</head><p>In this section, we detail the proposed pipeline to create PMC-OA, a large-scale dataset that contains 1.65M image-text pairs. The whole procedure consists of three major stages: (i) medical figure collection, (ii) subfigure separation, (iii) subcaption separation &amp; alignment, as summarised in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medical Figure Collection (</head><p>Step 1 and 2 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). We first extract figures and captions from PubMedCentral (till 2022-09-16) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. 2.4M papers are covered and 12M figure-caption pairs are extracted. To derive medical figures, inspired by MedICat <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, we first filter out the captions without any medical keywords<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> and then use a classification network trained on DocFigure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to further pick out the medical figure, ending up with 381K medical figures.</p><p>Subfigure Separation (Step 3 and 4 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). We randomly check around 300 figures from previous step, and find that around 80% of figures are compound, i.e. multiple pannels. We thus train a subfigure detector on MedICaT subfigure-subcaption subset <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> (MedICatSub) to break the compound figures into subfigures. After separation, to filter out non-medical subfigures missed in the former step, we apply the aforementioned classifier again on the derived subfigures, obtaining 1.6M subfigure-caption pairs. We termed this dataset as PMC-OA Beta version.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subcaption Separation and Alignment (</head><p>Step 5 and 6 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). To further align subfigure to its corresponding part within the full caption, i.e., subcaption, we need to break the captions into subcaptions first, we apply an off-shelf caption distributor <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. We pretrain a CLIP-style model (termed as PMC-CLIP-Beta, training detail will be described in Sect. 3) on PMC-OA-Beta, then finetune it on MedICaTSub for subfigure-subcaption alignment, which achieves alignment accuracy=73% on test set. We finally align 1,003,911 subfigure-subcaption pairs, along with the remaining 642,681 subfigure-caption pairs, we termed this dataset as PMC-OA. Note that, we have explicitly removed duplication between our data and ROCO by identify each image-caption pair with paperID and image source link. We consequently pretrain the PMC-CLIP on it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Dataset Overview</head><p>In this section, we provide a brief statistical overview of the collected dataset PMC-OA with UMLS parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> from three different perspectives, i.e., diagnostic procedure, diseases and findings, and fairness. First, PMC-OA covers a wide range of diagnostic procedures, spanning from common (CT, MRI) to rare ones (mitotic figure), which is more diverse than before (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(a)</ref>). Second, PMC-OA contains various diseases and findings, and is more up-to-date, covering new emergent diseases like COVID-19 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(b)</ref>). And the wide disease coverage in our dataset supports learning the shared patterns of diseases, promoting accurate auto-diagnosis. Third, we also provide the sex-ratio across ages in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(c</ref>), as we can see PMC-OA is approximately gender-balanced, with 54% males. The fairness on population ensures our dataset sightly suffers from patient characteristic bias, thus providing greater cross-center generalize ability.</p><p>Discussion. Compared to pioneering works <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref> for constructing dataset based on PubMedCentral, our proposed PMC-OA is of larger scale, diversity, and has more accurate alignment: First, PMC-OA covers a wider range of papers (2.4M) than ROCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>(1.8M) and MedICaT <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>(131K), and thus enlarge our dataset(1.6M). Second, unlike ROCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, we maintain the nonradiology images, which makes PMC-OA a more diverse biomedical dataset as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Third, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate subfigures separation, subcaptions separation and the alignment into the data collection pipeline, which explicitly enlarges our dataset (8 times of MedICaT and 20 times of ROCO), while reducing the noise as much as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Visual-language Pre-training</head><p>With our constructed image-caption dataset, we further train a visual-language model, termed as PMC-CLIP as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (bottom). We describe the architecture first and then introduce the two training objectives separately.</p><p>Architecture. Given N image-caption training pairs, i.e., D = {(I i , T i )| N i=1 }, where I i ∈ R H×W ×C represents images, H, W, C are height, width, channel, and T i represents the paired text. We aim to train a CLIP-style visual-language model with an image encoder Φ visual and a text encoder Φ text .</p><p>In detail, given a specific image-caption pair (I, T ), we encode it separately with a ResNet-based Φ visual and a BERT-based Φ text , the embedding dimension is denoted as d and the text token length as l:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v = Φ visual (I) ∈ R d , (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">T = Φ text (T ) ∈ R l×d , t = T 0 ∈ R d , (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where v represents the embedding for the whole image, T refers to the sentence embedding, and t denotes the embedding for [CLS] token.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Image-Text Contrastive Learning (ITC).</head><p>We implement ITC loss following CLIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, that aims to match the corresponding visual and text representations from one sample. In detail, denoting batch size as b, we calculate the softmaxnormalized cross-modality dot product similarity between the current visual/text embedding (v / t) and all samples within the batch, termed as p i2t , p t2i ∈ R b , and the final ITC loss is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L ITC = E (I,T )∼D CE(y i2t , p i2t ) + CE(y t2i , p t2i ) ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where y i2t , y t2i refer to one-hot matching labels, CE refers to InfoNCE loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Masked Language Modeling (MLM).</head><p>We implement MLM loss following BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The network is trained to reconstruct the masked tokens from context contents and visual cues. We randomly mask the word in texts with a probability of 15% and replace it with a special token '[MASK]'. We concatenate the image embedding v with the text token embeddings T , input it into a self-attention transformer-based fusion module Φ fusion , and get the prediction for the masked token at the corresponding position in the output sequence, termed as p mask = Φ fusion (v, T ). Let y mask denote the ground truth, and the MLM loss is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L MLM = E (I,T )∼D CE(y mask , p mask )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Total Training Loss. The final loss is defined as L = L ITC + λL MLM , where λ is a hyper-parameter deciding the weight of L MLM , set as 0.5 by default.</p><p>Disscussion. While we recognize a lot of progress in VLP methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36]</ref>, PMC-CLIP is trained in an essential way to demonstrate the potential of the collected PMC-OA, and thus should be orthogonal to these works.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiment Settings</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Pre-training Datasets</head><p>ROCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> is a image-caption dataset collected from PubMed <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. It filters out all the compound or non-radiological images, and consists of 81K samples.</p><p>MedICaT <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> extends ROCO to 217K samples (image-caption pairs), however, 75% of its figures are compound ones, i.e. one figure with multiple subfigures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is the largest chest X-ray dataset, containing 377,110 samples (image-report pairs). Each image is paired with a clinical report describing findings from doctors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MIMIC-CXR</head><p>PMC-OA contains 1.65M image-text pairs, which we have explicitly conducted deduplication between ROCO.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Downstream Tasks</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Image-Text Retrieval (ITR). ITR contains both image-to-text(I2T</head><p>) and text-to-image(T2I) retrieval. We train PMC-CLIP on different datasets, and sample 2,000 image-text pairs from ROCO's testset for evaluation, following previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>. Note that, as we have explicitly conducted deduplication, the results thus resemble zero-shot evaluation.</p><p>Classification. We finetune the model for different downstream tasks that focus on image classification. Spcifically, MedMINIST <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> contains 12 tasks for 2D images, and it covers primary data modalities in biomedical images, including Colon Pathology, Dermatoscope, Retinal OCT, etc.</p><p>Visual Question Answering (VQA). We evaluate on the official dataset split of SLAKE <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and follow previous work's split <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> on VQA-RAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, where SLAKE is composed of 642 images and 14,028 questions and VQA-RAD contains 315 images and 3,515 questions. The questions in VQA-RAD and Slake are categorized as close-ended if answer choices are limited, otherwise openended. The image and text encoders are initialized from PMC-CLIP and finetuned, we refer the reader for more details in supplementary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Implementation Details</head><p>For the visual and text encoders, we adopt ResNet50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and PubmedBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. And we use 4 transformer layers for the fusion module. For input data, we resize each image to 224 × 224. During pre-training, our text encoder is initialized from PubmedBERT, while the vision encoder and fusion module are trained from scratch. We use AdamW <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> optimizer with lr = 1 × 10 -4 . We train on GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs with batch size 128 for 100 epochs. The first 10 epochs are set for warming up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Result</head><p>We conduct experiments to validate our proposed dataset, and the effectiveness of model trained on it. In Sec. 5.1, we first compare with existing large-scale biomedical datasets on the image-text retrieval task to demonstrate the superiority of PMC-OA. In Sect. 5.2, we finetune the model (pre-trained on PMC-OA) across three different downstream tasks, namely, retrieval, classification, and visual question answering. And we also perform a thorough empirical study of the pretraining objectives and the model architectures in Sect. 5.3. Note that, for all experiments, we use the default setting: ResNet50 for image encoder, and pre-train with both ITC and MLM objectives, unless specified otherwise.</p></div>

As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, we report a state-of-the-art result on image-text retrieval. On I2T Rank@10, PMC-CLIP outperforms previous state-of-the-art by 8.1%. It is worth mentioning that, the training set of ROCO has been used during pretraining in M3AE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, ARL <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.

To demonstrate the excellent transferability of PMC-CLIP, we validate it on MedMNIST and compare it with SOTA methods i.e., DWT-CV <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and SADAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. We present the results of 3 of 12 sub-tests here, and the full results can be found in the supplementary material.

Here, we present a summary of the observations: First, ITC objective is essential for pretraining, and contributes most of the performance. Second, MLM using only text context works as a regularization term. Third, With incorporation of visual features, the model learns finer grain correlation between image-caption pairs, and achieve the best results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection Pipeline.</head><p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of subfiguresubcaption alignment, we compare PMC-CLIP with the model pretrained on dataset w/o alignment (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>(1-3) in the supplementary). The result verify that subfigure-subcaption alignment reduces dataset's noise thus enhance the pretrained model.</p><p>Visual Backbone. We have also explored different visual backbones, using the same setting as CLIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>(4-7) in the supplementary). We observe that all ResNet variants have close performance with RN50, outperforming ViT-B/32, potentially due to the large patch size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset in biomedical domain, named PMC-OA, by collecting image-caption pairs from abundant scientific docu-ments. We train a CLIP-style model on PMC-OA, termed as PMC-CLIP, it achieves SOTA performance across various downstream biomedical tasks, including image-text retrieval, image classification, visual question answering. With the automatic collection pipeline, the dataset can be further expanded, which can be beneficial to the research community, fostering development of foundation models in biomedical domain.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
