<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Under the framework of network-based neurodegeneration, brain functional connectome (FC)-based Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have emerged as a valuable tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, these models are tailored for brain FC at a single time point instead of characterizing FC trajectory. Discerning how FC evolves with disease progression, particularly at the predementia stages such as cognitively normal individuals with amyloid deposition or individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is crucial for delineating disease spreading patterns and developing effective strategies to slow down or even halt disease advancement. In this work, we proposed the first interpretable framework for brain FC trajectory embedding with application to neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and prognosis, namely Brain Tokenized Graph Transformer (Brain TokenGT). It consists of two modules: 1) Graph Invariant and Variant Embedding (GIVE) for generation of node and spatio-temporal edge embeddings, which were tokenized for downstream processing; 2) Brain Informed Graph Transformer Readout (BIGTR) which augments previous tokens with trainable type identifiers and nontrainable node identifiers and feeds them into a standard transformer encoder to readout. We conducted extensive experiments on two public longitudinal fMRI datasets of the AD continuum for three tasks, including differentiating MCI from controls, predicting dementia conversion in MCI, and classification of amyloid positive or negative cognitively normal</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The brain functional connectome (FC) is a graph with brain regions of interest (ROIs) represented as nodes and pairwise correlations of fMRI time series between the ROIs represented as edges. FC has been shown to be a promising biomarker for the early diagnosis and tracking of neurodegenerative disease progression (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease (AD)) because of its ability to capture disease-related alternations in brain functional organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Recently, the graph neural networks (GNN) has become the model of choice for processing graph structured data with state-of-the-art performance in different tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. With regards to FC, GNN has also shown promising results in disease diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. However, such studies have only focused on FC at a single time point. For neurodegenerative diseases like AD, it is crucial to investigate longitudinal FC changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, including graph topology and attributes, in order to slow down or even halt disease advancement.</p><p>Node features are commonly utilized in FC to extract important information. It is also essential to recognize the significance of edge features in FC, which are highly informative in characterizing the interdependencies between ROIs. Furthermore, node embeddings obtained from GNN manipulation contain essential information that should be effectively leveraged. Current GNNs feasible to graphs with multiple time points <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> are suboptimal to FC trajectory, as they fail to incorporate brain edge feature embeddings and/or they rely on conventional operation (e.g., global pooling for readout) which introduces inductive bias and is incapable of extracting sufficient information from the node embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Moreover, these models lack built-in interpretability, which is crucial for clinical applications. And they are unsuitable for small-scale datasets which are common in fMRI research. The longitudinal data with multiple time points of the AD continuum is even more scarce due to the difficulty in data acquisition.</p><p>In this work, we proposed Brain Tokenized Graph Transformer (Brain TokenGT), the first framework to achieve FC trajectory embeddings with builtin interpretability, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Our contributions are as follows: 1) Drawing on the distinctive characteristics of FC trajectories, we developed Graph Invariant and Variant Embedding (GIVE), which is capable of generating embeddings for both nodes and spatio-temporal edges; 2) Treating embeddings from GIVE as tokens, Brain Informed Graph Transformer Readout (BIGTR) augments tokens with trainable type identifiers and non-trainable node identifiers and feeds them into a standard transformer encoder to readout instead of global pooling, further extracting information from tokens and alleviating over-fitting issue by token-level task; 3) We conducted extensive experiments on two public resting state fMRI datasets (ADNI, OASIS) with three different tasks (Healthy Control (HC) vs. Mild Cognition Impairment (MCI) classification, AD conversion prediction and Amyloid positive vs. negative classification). Our model showed superior results with FC trajectory as input, accompanied by node and edge level interpretations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Problem Definition</head><p>The input of one subject to the proposed framework is a sequence of brain networks G = [G 1 , G 2 , ..., G t , ..., G T ] with T time points. Each network is a graph G = (V, E, A), with the node set V = {v i } M i=1 , the edge set E = V × V , and the weighted adjacency matrix A ∈ R M ×M describing the degrees of FC between ROIs. The output of the model is an individual-level categorical diagnosis ŷs for each subject s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Graph Invariant and Variant Embedding (GIVE)</head><p>Regarding graph topology, one of the unique characteristics of FC across a trajectory is that it has invariant number and sequence of nodes (ROIs), with variant connections between different ROIs. Here, we designed GIVE, which consists of Invariant Node Embedding (INE) and Variant Edge Embedding (VEE).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Invariant Node Embedding (INE).</head><p>To obtain node embeddings that capture the spatial and temporal information of the FC trajectory, we utilized evolving graph convolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for the K-hop neighbourhood around each node which could be seen as a fully dynamic graph, providing a novel "zoom in" perspective to see FC. As suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, with informative node features, we chose to treat parameters in graph convolutional layers as hidden states of the dynamic system and used a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to update the hidden states.</p><p>Formally, for each node v i in V , we define a dynamic neighbourhood graph as G i = [g i1 , g i2 , .., g it , ..., g iT ] (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), in which g it is the K-hop neighbourhood of node v i at time point t, with adjacency matrix A it . At time t, for dynamic neighbourhood graph G i , l-th layer of evolving graph convolution first updates parameter matrix W l i(t-1) from the last time point to W l it with GRU, then the node embeddings H l it are updated to H l+1 it for next layer using graph convolution network (GCN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W l it = GRU(H l it , W l i(t-1) ); H l+1 it = GCN(A it , H l it , W l it )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Variant Edge Embedding (VEE). For tasks such as graph classification, an appropriate representation of edges also plays a key role in the successful graph representation learning. To achieve edge embeddings, we first integrated graphs from multiple time points by defining Spatial Edge and Temporal Edge, and then obtained spatial and temporal edge embeddings by transforming an FC trajectory to the dual hypergraph.</p><p>For each FC trajectory, we should not only investigate the edges between different ROIs in one static FC (i.e., spatial domain) but also capture the longitudinal change across different time points (i.e., time domain). Instead of focusing only on intrinsic connections (i.e., spatial edges (e s )) between different ROIs in each FC, for each of the two consecutive graphs G t and G t+1 , we added M temporal edges (e t ) to connect corresponding nodes in G t and G t+1 , with weights initialized as 1. The attached features to spatial and temporal edges were both initialized by the concatenation of node features from both ends and their initial weights.</p><p>Accordingly, one trajectory would be treated as a single graph for downstream edge embedding. We denote the giant graph with T time points contained as G T , with weighted adjacency matrix A T ∈ R T M×T M (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). G T was first transformed into the dual hypergraph G T * by Dual Hypergraph Transformation (DHT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, where the role of nodes and edges in G T was exchanged while their information was preserved. DHT is accomplished by transposing the incidence matrix of the graph to the new incidence matrix of the dual graph, which is formally defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">G T = (X, M , E) → G T * = (E, M T , X), where X ∈ R M ×D</formula><p>is the original node features matrix with a D dimensional feature vector for each node, M ∈ R |E|×M is the original incidence matrix, and E ∈ R |E|×(2D+1) is the initialized edge features matrix.</p><p>We then performed hypergraph convolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to achieve node embeddings in G T * , which were the corresponding edge embeddings in G T . The hypergraph convolution at l th layer is defined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E (l+1) = D -1 M T W * B -1 M E (l) Θ (2)</formula><p>where W * is the diagonal hyperedge weight matrix, D and B are the degree matrices of the nodes and hyperedges respectively, and Θ is the parameters matrix.</p><p>Interpretability is important in decision-critical areas (e.g., disorder analysis). Thanks to the design of spatio-temporal edges, we could achieve built-in binary level interpretability (i.e., both nodes and edges contributing most to the given task, from e t and e s , respectively) by leveraging HyperDrop <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The HyperDrop procedure is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">idx = TopE(score(E)); E pool = E idx ; (M pool ) T = (M T idx )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where 'score' function is hypergraph convolution layers used to compute scores for each hypergraph node (e s or e t in the original graph). 'TopE' selects the nodes with the highest E scores (note: ranking was performed for nodes from e s and e t separately, and HyperDrop was only applied to nodes from e s with hyperparameter E), and idx is the node-wise indexing vector. Finally, the salient nodes (from e t ) and edges (from e s ) were determined by ranking the scores averaged across the trajectory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Brain Informed Graph Transformer Readout (BIGTR)</head><p>Proper readout for the embeddings from GNN manipulation is essential to produce meaningful prediction outcome for assisting diagnosis and prognosis. The vanilla ways are feeding the Node Embeddings, and Spatial and Temporal Edge Embeddings generated from the GIVE module into pooling and fully connected layers. However, this would result in a substantial loss of spatial and temporal information <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, especially under the complex settings of three types of spatial/temporal embeddings. Recently, it has been shown, both in theory and practice, that a standard transformer with appropriate token embeddings yields a powerful graph learner <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Here, treating embeddings output from GIVE as tokens, we leveraged graph transformer as a trainable readout function, named as Brain Informed Graph Transformer Readout (BIGTR) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). We first define the Type Identifier (TI) and Node Identifier (NI) under the setting of FC trajectory. Trainable TI encodes whether a token is a node, spatial edge or temporal edge. They are defined as a parameter matrix [P v ; P es ; P et ] ∈ R 3×dp , where P v , P es and P et are node, spatial edge and temporal edge identifier respectively. Specifically, we maintained a dictionary, in which the keys are types of the tokens, the values are learnable embeddings that encodes the corresponding token types. It facilitates the model's learning of type-specific attributes in tokens, compelling attention heads to focus on disease-related token disparities, thereby alleviating overfitting caused by non-disease-related attributes. Besides, it inflates 1 G T for an individual-level task to thousands of tokens, which could also alleviate overfitting in the perspective of small-scale datasets. Non-trainable NI are MT node-wise orthonormal vectors Q ∈ R MT ×dq for an FC trajectory with T time points and M nodes at each time. Then, the augmented token features become:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">z v = [x v , P v , Q v , Q v ] z (u,v) = [x (u,v) , P es , Q u , Q v ] z (v,v ) = [x (v,v ) , P et , Q v , Q v ]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>for v, e s and e t respectively, where node u is a neighbour to node v in the spatial domain and node v is a neighbour to node v in the temporal domain, and x is the original token from GIVE. Thus, the augmented token features matrix is Z ∈ R (MT +|E|T +M (T -1))×(h+dp+2dq) , where h is the hidden dimension of embeddings from GIVE. Z would be further projected by a trainable matrix ω ∈ R (h+dp+2dq)×h . As we targeted individual-level (i.e., G T ) diagnosis/prognosis, a graph token X [graph] ∈ R h was appended as well. Thus, the input to transformer is formally defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Z in = [X [graph] ; Zω] ∈ R (1+MT +|E|T +M (T -1))×h (5)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>Datasets and Experimental Settings. We used brain FC metrics derived from ADNI <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and OASIS-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> resting state fMRI datasets, following preprocessing pipelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Our framework was evaluated on three classification tasks related to diagnosis or prognosis: Results. AUC and accuracy are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. (Recall and Precision could be found in supplementary materials). Brain TokenGT and its ablations were compared with three types of baseline models, including 1) shallow machine learning: MK-SVM, RF and MLP; 2) one time point feasible deep learning: three representative deep graph models GCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, GAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and PNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and four state-of-the-art deep models specifically designed for FC: BrainnetCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, BrainGNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, IBGNN+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and BrainnetTF <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>; 3) multiple time points feasible deep learning: Onionnet <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, STGCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and EvolveGCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. To ensure a fair comparison between models, the one-dimensional vectors flattened from FC in all time points were concatenated and used as input for the shallow learning model. For the one time point feasible deep learning models, a prediction value was generated at each time point and subsequently averaged to obtain an individuallevel prediction.</p><p>The experimental results (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) demonstrate that the Brain TokenGT significantly outperformed all three types of baseline by a large margin. The ablation study further revealed that GIVE w/o e t w/ GP outperformed EvolveGCN by adding VEE without e t , which empirically validates the importance of edge feature embeddings in FC. The performance could be further improved by incorporating e t , suggesting the efficiency of our GIVE design with spatiotemporal edges. Interestingly, BIGTR itself (i.e., the original features were directly input to BIGTR without GIVE) showed competitive performance with STGCN. Replacing GP with transformer (Ours w/o I) led to improved performance even without identifiers, indicating that the embeddings from GIVE may already capture some spatial and temporal information from the FC trajectory. The addition of identifiers further improved performance, possibly because the token-level self-supervised learning could alleviate the over-fitting issue and node identifiers could maintain the localized information effectively. Interpretation. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the top 5 salient edges and nodes retained by HyperDrop for each of the three tasks. Consistent with previous literature on brain network breakdown in the early stage of AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, parahippocampal, orbitofrontal and temporal regions and their connections contributed highly to all three tasks, underscoring their critical roles in AD-specific network dysfunction relevant to disease progression. On the other hand, superior frontal region additionally contributed to the amyloid positive vs. negative classification, which is in line with previous studies in amyloid deposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>This study proposes the first interpretable framework for the embedding of FC trajectories, which can be applied to the diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases with small scale datasets, namely Brain Tokenized Graph Transformer (Brain TokenGT).
