<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>MRI synthesis promises to mitigate the challenge of missing MRI modality in clinical practice. Diffusion model has emerged as an effective technique for image synthesis by modelling complex and variable data distributions. However, most diffusion-based MRI synthesis models are using a single modality. As they operate in the original image domain, they are memory-intensive and less feasible for multi-modal synthesis. Moreover, they often fail to preserve the anatomical structure in MRI. Further, balancing the multiple conditions from multi-modal MRI inputs is crucial for multi-modal synthesis. Here, we propose the first diffusion-based multi-modality MRI synthesis model, namely Conditioned Latent Diffusion Model (CoLa-Diff). To reduce memory consumption, we perform the diffusion process in the latent space. We propose a novel network architecture, e.g., similar cooperative filtering, to solve the possible compression and noise in latent space. To better maintain the anatomical structure, brain region masks are introduced as the priors of density distributions to guide diffusion process. We further present auto-weight adaptation to employ multi-modal information effectively. Our experiments demonstrate that CoLa-Diff outperforms other stateof-the-art MRI synthesis methods, promising to serve as an effective tool for multi-modal MRI synthesis.</p></div>

Multiple MRI modalities offer complementary information for characterizing brain tumours and enhancing patient L. Jiang and Y. Mao-Contribute equally in this work.</p><p>management <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>. However, acquiring multi-modality MRI is time-consuming, expensive and sometimes infeasible in specific modalities, e.g., due to the hazard of contrast agent <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Trans-modal MRI synthesis can establish the mapping from the known domain of available MRI modalities to the target domain of missing modalities, promising to generate missing MRI modalities effectively. The synthetic methods leveraging multi-modal MRI, i.e., many-to-one translation, have outperformed single-modality models generating a missing modality from another available modality, i.e., one-to-one translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref>. Traditional multi-modal methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>, e.g., sparse encoding-based, patch-based and atlasbased methods, rely on the alignment accuracy of source and target domains and are poorly scalable. Recent generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variants, e.g., MM-GAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, DiamondGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and ProvoGAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, have been successful based on multi-modal MRI, further improved by introducing multi-modal coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, enhanced architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and novel learning strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the success, GAN-based models are challenged by the limited capability of adversarial learning in modelling complex multi-modal data distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> Recent studies have demonstrated that GANs' performance can be limited to processing and generating data with less variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In addition, GANs' hyperparameters and regularization terms typically require fine-tuning, which otherwise often results in gradient vanish and mode collapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Diffusion model (DM) has achieved state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing natural images, promising to improve MRI synthesis models. It shows superiority in model training <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, producing complex and diverse images <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, while reducing risk of modality collapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.For instance, Lyu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> used diffusion and score-marching models to quantify model uncertainty from Monte-Carlo sampling and average the output using different sampling methods for CT-to-MRI generation; Özbey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> leveraged adversarial training to increase the step size of the inverse diffusion process and further designed a cycle-consistent architecture for unpaired MRI translation.</p><p>However, current DM-based methods focus on one-to-one MRI translation, promising to be improved by many-to-one methods, which requires dedicated design to balance the multiple conditions introduced by multi-modal MRI. Moreover, as most DMs operate in original image domain, all Markov states are kept in memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, resulting in excessive burden. Although latent diffusion model (LDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> is proposed to reduce memory consumption, it is less feasible for many-to-one MRI translation with multi-condition introduced. Further, diffusion denoising processes tend to change the original distribution structure of the target image due to noise randomness <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, rending DMs often ignore the consistency of anatomical structures embedded in medical images, leading to clinically less relevant results. Lastly, DMs are known for their slow speed of diffusion sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, challenging its wide clinical application.</p><p>We propose a DM-based multi-modal MRI synthesis model, CoLa-Diff, which facilitates many-to-one MRI translation in latent space, and preserve anatomical structure with accelerated sampling. Our main contributions include: -present a denoising diffusion probabilistic model based on multi-modal MRI.</p><p>As far as we know, this is the first DM-based many-to-one MRI synthesis model. -design a bespoke architecture, e.g., similar cooperative filtering, to better facilitate diffusion operations in the latent space, reducing the risks of excessive information compression and high-dimensional noise. -introduce structural guidance of brain regions in each step of the diffusion process, preserving anatomical structure and enhancing synthesis quality. -propose an auto-weight adaptation to balance multi-conditions and maximise the chance of leveraging relevant multi-modal information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Multi-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the model design. As a latent diffusion model, CoLa-diff integrates multi-condition b from available MRI contrasts in a compact and low-dimensional latent space to guide the generation of missing modality x ∈ R H×W ×1 . Precisely, b constitutes available contrasts and anatomical structure masks generated from the available contrasts. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>, CoLa-Diff invovles a forward and a reverse diffusion process. During forward diffusion, x 0 is encoded by E to produce κ 0 , then subjected to T diffusion steps to gradually add noise and generate a sequence of intermediate representations: {κ 0 , . . . , κ T }.</p><p>The t-th intermediate representation is denoted as κ t , expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">κ t = √ ᾱt κ 0 + √ 1 -ᾱt , with ∼ N (0, I)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ᾱt = t i=1 α i , α i denotes hyper-parameters related to variance. The reverse diffusion is modelled by a latent space network with parameters θ, inputting intermediate perturbed feature maps κ t and y (compressed b) to predict noise level θ (κ t , t, y) for recovering feature maps κt-1 from previous,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">κt-1 = √ ᾱt-1 ( κ t - √ 1 -ᾱt • θ (κ t , t, y) √ ᾱt ) + 1 -ᾱt-1 • θ (κ t , t, y) (2)</formula><p>To enable effective learning of the underlying distribution of κ 0 , the noise level needs to be accurately estimated. To achieve this, the network employs similar cooperative filtering and auto-weight adaptation strategies. κ0 is recovered by repeating Eq. 2 process for t times, and decoding the final feature map to generate synthesis images x0 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Structural Guidance</head><p>Unlike natural images, medical images encompass rich anatomical information. Therefore, preserving anatomical structure is crucial for MRI generation. However, DMs often corrupt anatomical structure, and this limitation could be due to the learning and sampling processes of DMs that highly rely on the probability density function <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, while brain structures by nature are overlapping in MRI density distribution and even more complicated by pathological changes. Previous studies show that introducing geometric priors can significantly improve the robustness of medical image generation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>. Therefore, we hypothesize that incorporating structural prior could enhance the generation quality with preserved anatomy. Specifically, we exploit FSL-FAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> tool to segment four types of brain tissue: white matter, grey matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and tumour. The generated tissue masks and inherent density distributions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 (E</ref>)) are then used as a condition y i to guide the reverse diffusion.</p><p>The combined loss function for our multi-conditioned latent diffusion is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L MCL := L E + L KL (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where KL is the KL divergence loss to measure similarity between real q and predicted p θ distributions of encoded images.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L KL := T -1 j=1 D KL (q (κ j-1 | κ j , κ 0 ) p θ (κ j-1 | κ j ))<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where D KL is the KL divergence function.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Comparisons with State-of-the-Art Methods</head><p>Datasets and Baselines. We evaluated CoLa-Diff on two multi-contrast brain MRI datasets: BRATS 2018 and IXI datasets. The BRATS 2018 contains MRI scans from 285 glioma patients. Each includes four modalities: T1, T2, T1ce, and FLAIR. We split them into (190:40:55) for training/validation/testing. For each subject, we automatically selected axial cross-sections based on the perceptible effective area of the slices, and then cropped the selected slices to a size of 224 × 224. The IXI<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> dataset consists of 200 multi-contrast MRIs from healthy brains, plit them into (140:25:35) for training/validation/testing. For preprocessing, we registered T2-and PD-weighted images to T1-weighted images using FSL-FLIRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and other preprocessing are identical to the BRATS 2018. We compared CoLa-Diff with four state-of-the-art multi-modal MRI synthesis methods: MM-GAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, Hi-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, ProvoGan <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> and LDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. Implementation Details. Our code is publicly available at https://github. com/SeeMeInCrown/CoLa Diff MultiModal MRI Synthesis. The hyperparameters of CoLa-Diff are defined as follows: diffusion steps to 1000; noise schedule to linear; attention resolutions to 32, 16, 8; batch size to 8, learning rate to 9.6e -5.</p><p>The noise variances were in the range of β 1 = 10 -4 and β T = 0.02. An exponential moving average (EMA) over model parameters with a rate of 0.9999 was employed. The model is trained on 2 NVIDIA RTX A5000, 24 GB with Adam optimizer on PyTorch. An acceleration method <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> based on knowledge distillation was applied for fast sampling. Quantitative Results. We performed synthesis experiments for all modalities, with each modality selected as the target modality while remaining modalities and the generated region masks as conditions. Seven cases were tested in two datasets (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The results show that CoLa-Diff outperforms other models by up to 6.01 dB on PSNR and 5.74% on SSIM. Even when compared to the best of other models in each task, CoLa-Diff is a maximum of 0.81 dB higher in PSNR and 0.82% higher in SSIM. Qualitative Results. The first three and last three rows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> illustrate the synthesis results of T1ce from BRATS and PD from the IXI, respectively. From the generated images, we observe that CoLa-Diff is most comparable to the ground truth, with fewer errors shown in the heat maps. The synthesis uncertainty for each region is derived by performing 100 generations of the same slice and calculating the pixel-wise variance. From the uncertainty maps, CoLa-Diff is more confident in synthesizing the gray and white matter over other comparison models. Particularly, CoLa-Diff performs better in generating complex brain sulcus and tumour boundaries. Further, CoLa-Diff could better maintain the anatomical structure over comparison models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Ablation Study and Multi-modal Exploitation Capabilities</head><p>We verified the effectiveness of each component in CoLa-Diff by removing them individually. We experimented on BRATS T1+T1ce+FLAIR→T2 task with four absence scenarios (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> top). Our results show that each component contributes to the performance improvement, with Auto-weight adaptation bringing a PSNR increase of 1.9450dB and SSIM of 4.0808%.</p><p>To test the generalizability of CoLa-Diff under the condition of varied inputs, we performed the task of generating T2 on two datasets with progressively increasing input modalities (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> bottom). Our results show that our model performance increases with more input modalities: SSIM has a maximum uplift value of 1.9603, PSNR rises from 26.6355 dB to 28.3126 dB in BRATS; from 32.164 dB to 32.8721 dB in IXI. The results could further illustrate the ability of CoLa-Diff to exploit multi-modal information. </p></div>
