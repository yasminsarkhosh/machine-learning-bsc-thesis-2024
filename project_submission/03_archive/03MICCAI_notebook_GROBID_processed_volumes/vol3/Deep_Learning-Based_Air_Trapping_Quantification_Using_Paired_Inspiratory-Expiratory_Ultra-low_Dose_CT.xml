The best model achieved a patch-based DICE coefficient of 0.82 evaluated on the test set. AT percentages correlated strongly with MBW results (LD: R = 0.76, p &lt; 0.001; ULD: R = 0.78, p &lt; 0.001). A strong correlation between LD and ULD (R = 0.96, p &lt; 0.001) and small ULD-LD differences (mean difference -1.04 ¬± 3.25%) were observed. Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is a progressive respiratory condition. It originates from a defect in the cystic fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene which causes a mucociliary dysfunction and airway mucus plugging, provoking chronic neutrophilic airway inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. One of the early marker of CF detectable by imaging is the pathological retention of air in the lungs after exhalation. It is commonly designated as air trapping (AT). AT visually constitutes as low attenuation areas in the lung parenchyma observable on expiratory computed tomography (CT) scans. Conventional threshold-based methods for air trapping quantification (e.g. the -856 HU threshold on expiratory CT) are density-based and primarily designed for adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. They depend on the CT protocol in use and the constitution of the patient. The CT dose, in particular, plays an important role which raises the question about the influence of dose reduction on AT quantification. More personalized thresholds have been defined by Goris et al. who use the median and 90 percentile of the inspiratory histogram of densities together with the difference in the 90 percentile values between expiration and inspiration <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Nowadays, low dose (LD) CT is considered established standard in pediatric lung CT imaging. Ultra-low dose (ULD) CT has been implemented recently and requires comprehensive validation.</p><p>To address the aforementioned issues concerning AT quantification in children with CF, we investigated a deep learning approach to quantify air trapping on ULDCT in comparison to LDCT. Structure-function relationships were assessed by comparison against multiple breath washout (MBW) lung function testing. The applied deep learning method is adopted from the one-channel approach proposed by Ram et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> who trained a densely connected convolutional neural network (DenseNet) on LDCT. It achieved a good AT quantification with respect to the ground truth derived from an algorithm developed by Goris et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for generating subject-specific thresholds. The structure-function relationships for the deep learning approach were investigated by Bayfield et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, on the same ULD-LDCT dataset, which we now used to train our model. The authors observed that the percentage of AT, detected by the model from Ram et al., did not correlate with pulmonary function test results. In a research letter published in the European Respiratory Journal, Bayfield et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> address the urgency of reliable AT quantification on ULDCT. For this reason, we investigated the influence of dose reduction on AT quantification. We aimed to achieve a good AT segmentation on ULD as well as LDCT while maintaining structurefunction relationships. In this context, we examined the usage of one or two input channels and the training on one or both scan protocols.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Post-processing</head><p>The inspiratory CT scan was registered to the expiratory CT scan by applying 3-D deformable image registration using the image registration tool Elastix (version 5.0.1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. A representative registration result is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The subsequent post-processing steps are outlined in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Lung masks were generated using the CT analysis software YACTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The generated lung masks were applied to the CT images to permit an undeflected focus on the lungs. All CT images were normalized between zero and one. The mean threshold from radiographic assessments, performed separately by two trained radiologists, was used as ground truth. To generate the ground truth segmentation, the radiologist loaded the inspiratory and corresponding expiratory CT scan in our inhouse software. After loading, the scans were displayed next to each other where the radiologist could go through each of them individually. The segmentation was not drawn manually by the radiologist. Instead, we used a patient-specific threshold T. An AT map was generated by classifying all expiratory CT voxels &lt; T as AT. Using an integrated slider functionality, the radiologist was asked to choose T for each patient such that the AT map best describes the trapped air. Since a manual AT assessment is very time-consuming, the slider-based approach provides a good trade-off between time consumption and accuracy. With this technique, we are able to guarantee a high ground truth quality since two trained radiologists selected a personalized threshold for each patient and no generic method was used. 2-D patches were created from the 2-D axial slices of the expiratory, the corresponding registered inspiratory CT scan and the ground truth segmentation. A sliding window with a patch size p of 32 and stride s was used as demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The generated patches were then utilized as oneor two-channel input to a densely connected convolutional neural network which was trained to segment AT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">DenseNet Architecture and Training</head><p>A sketch of the DenseNet architecture is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. It has a common u-net structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and is adopted from Ram et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Each dense block contains four dense block layers where each dense block layer consists of a batch normalization (BN), a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and a 3 √ó 3 convolution. For downsampling, BN, a ReLU activation, a 1 √ó 1 convolution and a 2 √ó 2 max pooling operation with a stride of two are used. Upsampling is implemented using a 3 √ó 3 transposed convolution with a stride of two.</p><p>In the last layer, a 1 √ó 1 convolution and a softmax operation are performed to obtain the output probability map. The network was trained to minimize the Dice loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Weights were optimized using stochastic gradient decent (Momentum) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> with a momentum term of Œ≤ = 0.9 and a learning rate of Œ± = 0.001. The implementation is done in PyTorch <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> (version 1.12.1) using Python version 3.10 (Python Software Foundation, Python Language Reference, http://www.python.org). No augmentation has been used. In contrast to Ram et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the registered inspiratory CT scan was added as second input channel to the network and the model was trained on 2-D patches instead of slices. We argue that, as for the radiologist, using the inspiration CT as second input can add useful information in the form of inspiration expiration differences. Patches were selected over slices to increase the number of training samples. The subsequent experiments were executed on a high performance computing cluster. On the cluster, the method ran on a NVIDIA Tesla V100 HBM2 RAM with 32 GB of memory. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Model Evaluation</head><p>The DenseNet AT percentages used to compute the correlations presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> are computed as the normalized sum of the DenseNet output probabilities using the best model in terms of DICE coefficient evaluated on the validation set. Since the network outputs a probability map, for computing the DICE coefficient over the patches, the output probabilities were converted to binary maps classifying all probabilities ‚â• 0.5 as 1, and 0 otherwise. In the same way, the so-called quantitative AT (QAT) values which can be found in the upper right of the overlayed ground truth and DenseNet output images of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>, were computed as the percentage of AT over the entire lung using the binary segmentation maps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>For each model of each parameter combination obtained from cross-validation, the DICE coefficient was computed over the patches from the test set. Resulting mean DICE coefficients and standard deviations over the 5-folds for the different parameter combinations are presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The highest DICE coefficient was achieved when training the network on two channels using a stride of 16.</p><p>Here, the best model achieved a score of 0.82. It was trained on both, LD and ULD. The scores did not differ noticeably (third decimal) when training on LD only (mean DICE coefficient 0.806 ¬± 0.213) compared to including both scan protocols, LD and ULD (0.809 ¬± 0.216).</p><p>Analyzing the correlations of the percentage of AT in the lungs detected by the best DenseNet model of the five folds between LD and ULD, strong correlations and small ULD-LD differences become apparent for all tested parameter Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Grid search results for the different parameter combinations evaluated on the test set. Mean DICE coefficent and standard deviation (evaluated on patches) computed over the five models. Mean ULD-LD difference of the percentage of AT obtained from the best DenseNet model of the five folds, presented together with the correlations (Pearson's R) between LD and ULD and with the LCI for LD and ULD (p &lt; 0.001 for all R).  combinations (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The table shows that the mean ULD-LD difference is lower when training with one compared to two channels. Comparing the correlation of the AT percentage in the lungs detected by the best DenseNet models with the LCI for LD and ULD (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), the strongest correlations were achieved when training LD and ULD together using a 2-channel input. Applying a stride of 32 results in a strong correlation for LD (R = 0.77, p &lt; 0.001) and ULD (R = 0.78, p &lt; 0.001) which can be also achieved using overlapping patches with a stride of 16 (LD (R = 0.76, p &lt; 0.001) and ULD (R = 0.78, p &lt; 0.001)). A strong correlation between LD and ULD (R = 0.96, p &lt; 0.001) and small ULD-LD differences (mean difference -1.04 ¬± 3.25%) can be observed. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows the inputs, the corresponding ground truth segmentation, and the resulting DenseNet output probability map for a representative LD scan (left) and its corresponding ULD scan (right). The model used for evaluation was trained on LD only using a two-channel input and a stride of 32. Comparing the DenseNet output with the ground truth, a good AT segmentation can be observed for LD and ULD. The segmentation results demonstrate that although only trained on LD, a good AT quantification can also be obtained for ULD. The deep learning method detected less AT than the ground truth. This becomes apparent by looking at the QAT values, displayed in white, in the upper right of the overlayed images. However, the difference between the DenseNet and the ground truth segmentations is small for LD (QAT value difference: -2.68%) as well as ULD (QAT value difference: -1.2%). As presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, the conventional -856 HU threshold has only a small overlap with the ground truth radiographic assessment resulting in a low slicebased DICE coefficient of 0.379 ¬± 0.230, suggesting that this threshold is less suitable for children. The subject-specific threshold method from Goris et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, on the other hand, achieves a noticeably higher DICE coefficient of 0.645¬±0.171. The best DenseNet model achieves the highest DICE coefficient of the compared methods but less strong correlations with the LCI.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>In this study, we trained a densely connected convolutional neural network to segment AT using 2-D patches of the expiratory and corresponding registered inspiratory CT scan slices. We wanted to evaluate the best settings and the effect of a noticeable dose reduction on AT quantification.</p><p>Using a smaller stride and respectively more patches only resulted in a slightly higher patch-based DICE coefficient evaluated on the test set (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). No noticeable increase in DICE coefficient could be observed for the models trained on both scan protocols or two input channels, compared to the reference. Only small differences were observed regarding the correlations of the DenseNet AT percentage between LD and ULD, and the DenseNet AT with the LCI for LD and ULD. Since furthermore only small ULD-LD differences were observed, the study indicates that the ULD scan protocol allows a comparable air trapping quantification, in comparison to the standard. Good correlations and small ULD-LD differences are also obtained with the models trained on LD only which proposes that training the model on both, LDCT and ULDCT is not necessarily needed. Adding the registered inspiratory scan as a second input channel to the network shows slight improvements in AT detection compared to a 1-channel approach. Future work will investigate to what extent an improved image registration can further improve the performance of the 2-channel approach. The comparison with other AT quantification methods, more precisely, the largest agreement with the radiographic ground truth segmentation in combination with a less strong correlation with the LCI might eventually indicate that the deep learning method is more sensible and detects structural impairment when function test results are still in a normal range (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). Furthermore, it highlights the importance to distinguish AT severities when comparing structure-function relationships.</p><p>It is important to note the limitations of this study. First of all, it should be mentioned that generating ground truth is a difficult task even for experienced radiologists, which is not always clearly solvable. In addition, the results presented are limited to the available number of patients. Children were scanned at inspiration and expiration, with two different scan protocols, without leaving the CT table. This results in four scans for each patient and explains the limited availability of patients to be included in the study. The particularity of the dataset clarifies why the model could not easily be tested on an independent test dataset since there is none available obtained in a comparable manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We were able to show that similar QAT indices can be calculated on ULD CT images despite an 82% reduced dose. QAT values were comparable for ULD and LD across all parameter combinations. The relationship to the LCI was retained. AT is not only an early sign of incipient pulmonary dysfunction in patients with CF, but also in other diseases such as COPD or asthma. We want to investigate how our DenseNet performs on other data sets of patients with CF, COPD or asthma and, if necessary, expand the amount of training data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Keywords:</head><label></label><figDesc>Deep Learning ‚Ä¢ Air Trapping Quantification ‚Ä¢ Cystic Fibrosis 1 Introduction</figDesc></figure>

Training was performed in 5-fold cross-validation where each model was trained for 100 epochs. Following parameters were varied during grid search: stride, number of channels and the scan protocols included in the training analyzing if using LDCT scans only, or both, LD and ULDCT scans, should be included in the training. Only patches containing at least 50% of lung tissue are considered to only include the most informative patches.</figDesc></figure>
