<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) enables identifying immune cell subtypes across histopathology images. There is substantial evidence to show that spatial architecture of immune cell populations (e.g. CD4+, CD8+, CD20+) is associated with therapy response in cancers, yet there is a paucity of approaches to quantify spatial statistics of interplay across immune subtypes. Previously, analyzing spatial cell interplay have been limited to either building subgraphs on individual cell types before feature extraction or capturing the interaction between two cell types. However, looking at the spatial interplay between more than two cell types reveals complex interactions and co-dependencies that might have implications in predicting response to therapies like immunotherapy. In this work we present, Triangular Analysis of Geographical Interplay of Lymphocytes (TriAnGIL), a novel approach involving building of heterogeneous subgraphs to precisely capture the spatial interplay between multiple cell families. Primarily, Tri-AnGIL focuses on triadic closures, and uses metrics to quantify triads instead of two-by-two relations and therefore considers both inter-and intra-family relationships between cells. The TriaAnGIL's efficacy for microenvironment characterization from QIF images is demonstrated in problems of predicting (1) response to immunotherapy (N = 122) and (2) overall survival (N = 135) in patients with lung cancer in comparison with four hand-crafted approaches namely DenTIL, GG, CCG, SpaTIL, and deep learning with GNN. For both tasks, TriaAnGIL outperformed hand-crafted approaches, and GNN with AUC = .70, C-index = .64. In terms of interpretability, TriAnGIL easily beats GNN, by pulling biological insights from immune cells interplay and shedding light on the triadic interaction of CD4+-Tumor-stromal cells.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The tumor microenvironment (TME) is comprised of cancer, immune (e.g. B lymphocytes, and T lymphocytes), stromal, and other cells together with noncellular tissue components <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. It is well acknowledged that tumors evolve in close interaction with their microenvironment. Quantitatively characterizing TME has the potential to predict tumor aggressiveness and treatment response <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Different types of lymphocytes such as CD4+ (helper T cells), CD8+ (cytotoxic T cells), CD20+ (B cells), within the TME naturally interact with tumor and stromal cells. Studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> have shown that quantifying spatial interplay of these different cell families within the TME can provide more prognostic/predictive value compared to only measuring the density of a single biomarker such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Immunotherapy (IO) is the standard treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> but only 27-45% of patients respond to this treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Therefore, better algorithms and improved biomarkers are essential for identifying which cancer patients are most likely to respond to IO in advance of treatment. Quantitative features that relate to the complex spatial interplay between different types of B-and T-cells in the TME might unlock attributes that are associated with IO response. In this study, we introduce a novel approach called Triangular Analysis of Geographical Interplay of Lymphocytes (TriAnGIL), representing a unique and interpretable way to characterize the distribution, and higher-order interaction of various cell families (e.g., cancerous cells, stromal cells, lymphocyte subtypes) across digital histopathology slides. We demonstrate the efficacy of TriaAnGIL for characterizing TME in the context of predicting 1) response to IO with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), 2) overall survival (OS), in patients with NSCLC, and 3) providing novel insights into the spatial interplay between different immune cell subtype. TriAnGIL source code is publicly available at http://github.com/sarayar/TriAnGIL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Previous Related Work and Novel Contributions</head><p>Many studies have only looked at the density of a single biomarker (e.g. TILs), to show that a high density of TILs is associated with improved patient survival and treatment response in NSCLC <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Other works have attempted to characterize the spatial arrangement of cells in TME using computational graphbased approaches. These approaches include methods that connect cells regardless of their type (1) using global graphs (GG) such as Voronoi that connect all nuclei <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, or (2) using Cell cluster graphs (CCG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to create multiple nuclear subgraphs based on cell-to-cell proximity to predict tumor aggressiveness and patient outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Others have explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> the spatial interplay between two different cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.One example approach is Spatial architecture of TIL (SpaTIL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> which attempted to characterize the interplay between immune and cancer cells and has proven to be helpful in predicting the recurrence in early-stage NSCLC. All of these approaches point to overwhelming evidence that spatial architecture of cells in TME is critical in predicting cancer outcome. However, these approaches have not been able to exploit higher-order interactions and dependencies between multiple cell types (&gt; 2), relationships that might provide additional actionable insights. The contributions of this work include:</p><p>(1) TriAnGIL is a computational framework that characterizes the architecture and relationships of different cell types simultaneously. Instead of measuring only simple two-by-two relations between cells, it seeks to identify triadic spatial relations (hyperedges <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>  have shown great capabilities in solving complex problems in the biomedical field, these tend to be black-box in nature. A key consideration in cancer immunology is the need for actionable insights into the spatial relationships between different types of immune cells. Not only does TriAnGIL provide predictions that are on par or superior compared to DL approaches, but also provides a way to glean insights into the spatial interplay of different immune cell types. These complex interactions enhance our understanding of the TME and will help pave the way for new therapeutic strategies that leverage these insights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Description of TriAnGIL Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Notation</head><p>Our approach consists of constructing heterogeneous graphs step by step and quantifying them by extracting features from them. The graphs are defined by G = (V, E), where V is the set of vertices (nodes) V = {v 1 , ...v N } with τ n vertex types, and E is the collection of pairs of vertices from V, E = {e 1 , ...e M }, which are called edges and φ n is the mapping function that maps every vertex to one of n differential marker expressions in this dataset φ n : V → τ n . G is represented by an adjacency matrix A that allows one to determine edges in constant time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Node Linking and Computation of Graph-Interplay Features</head><p>The inputs of TriAnGIL are the coordinates of nuclear centroids and the corresponding cell types. In the TriAnGIL procedure, the centroid of each nucleus in a family is represented as a node of a graph. TriAnGIL is agnostic of the method used for identifying the coordinates and types. Once the different cell families are identified (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1-B</ref>), a list is generated for all possible sets comprising of membership from three <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> different cell families. By focusing on every set, TriAnGIL allows for capturing higher-order and balanced spatial triadic relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> between cell families, while keeping the computational complexity relatively low. Therefore, we initiate the process with the first set on the list (α, β, γ), build heterogeneous graphs, extract features, and then select another set until we have explored all possible triads of cell families on the list. The three main steps of TriAnGIL is as follows:</p><p>1) Quantifying in absence of one family: First, we build a proximity graph (G 1 ) on nodes of α, β, γ based on the Euclidean distance of every two nodes. Two nodes will be connected if their distance is shorter than a given "interaction rate", θ regardless of their family and cell type (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>-C, 1-C1). The interaction rate is a hyper-parameter that controls how close we expect the distance to be so that we consider some interaction between the nodes.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">{G 1 = (V, E) | ∀e ∈ E : |e| &lt;= θ} (1)</formula><p>We then exclude the nodes of α from all the interactions by removing its edges from G1 and characterize the relationship of β and γ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1-C2</ref>). Next, we extract a series of features including clustering coefficient, average degree from the resulting subgraph. We repeat this process by removing all the edges of β (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1-C3</ref>) and then γ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1-C4</ref>). In this manner, a total of 126 features (supplemental Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) are extracted (42 features for absence of one family ×3). 2) Triangulation-based connections: A Delaunay triangulation is constructed by the nodes of α, β, γ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1-D</ref>, and 1-D1). Delaunay triangulation is a planar graph formed by connecting the vertices in a way that ensures no point lies within the circumcircle of any triangle formed by the vertices <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>We then extract 10 features relating to edge length and vertex count. Next, we prune long edges (D 1 ) where the Euclidean distance between connected nodes is more than the "interaction rate" (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1-D2</ref>). Next, a series of features were extracted from the remaining subgraph (e.g. number of edges between the nodes of α and β, β and γ, α and γ; complete list of features in supplemental Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">{D 1 = (V, E) | ∀e ∈ E : |e| &lt;= θ} (2)</formula><p>3) Triangular interactions: As illustrated in Algorithm 1, from the unpruned Delaunay triangulation that includes the nodes of α, β, γ, we select those triangles (closed triads <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>) that link nodes from three distinct families (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1-E, 1-E1</ref>). In other words, we remove triangles with more than one vertex from a single family. Next, we call GetTriangleFeatures() function to quantify triangular relationships by extracting features from the resulting subgraphs (e.g. perimeter and area of triangles; complete list of features in supplemental Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Results and Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Dataset</head><p>The cohort employed in this study was composed of pre-treatment tumor biopsy specimens from patients with NSCLC from five centers (two centers for training (S t ) and three centers for independent validation (S v )). The entire analysis was carried out using 122 patients in Experiment 1 (73 in S t , and 49 in S v ) and 135 patients in Experiment 2 (81 in S t , and 54 in S v ). Specimens were analyzed with a multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) panel using the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. From each whole slide image, 7 representative tiles were obtained and used to train the software InForm to define background, tumor and stromal compartments. Then, individual cells were segmented based on nuclear DAPI staining and the segmentation performance was controlled by direct visualization of samples by a trained observer. Next, the software was trained to identify cell subtypes based on marker expression (CD8, CD4, CD20, CK for tumor epithelial cells and absence of these markers for stromal cells).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Comparative Approaches</head><p>The efficacy of TriAnGIL was compared against five different approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TIL density (DenTIL):</head><p>For every patient, multiple density measures including the number of different cells types and their ratios are calculated <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> (supplemental Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GG: A Delaunay triangulation, a Voronoi diagram, and a Minimum Spanning</head><p>Tree were constructed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> on all nuclei regardless of their type. Architectural features (e.g., perimeter, triangle area, edge length) were then calculated on these global graphs for each patient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CCG:</head><p>For every patient, subgraphs are built on nuclei regardless of their type and only based on their Euclidean distance. Local graph metrics (e.g. clustering coefficient) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> are then calculated from these subgraphs. SpaTIL: For each patient, first, subgraphs are built on individual cell types based on a distance parameter. The convex hulls are then constructed on these subgraphs. After selecting every two cell types, features are extracted from their convex hulls (e.g. the number of clusters of each cell type, area intersected between clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>; complete list of combinations in supplemental Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GNN:</head><p>A recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> demonstrated that Transformer-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> GNNs are able to learn the arrangement of tiles across pathology images for survival analysis. Here, for each tile in the slide, a Delaunay graph was constructed regardless of cell subtypes, and tile-level feature representations (e.g.side length minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation, triangle area minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation) were aggregated by a Transformer according to their spatial arrangement <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Our approach utilized the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for embedding graphs into Euclidean feature space. Well-known approaches, such as GraphSage <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, are considered as continuous approximations to the WL test. Therefore, our GNN is a valid baseline for heterogeneous graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Experiment 1: Immunotherapy Response Prediction in Lung Cancer</head><p>Design: TriAnGIL was also trained to differentiate between patients who responded to IO and those who did not. For our study, the responders to IO were identified as those patients with complete response, partial response, and stable disease, and non-responders were patients with progressive disease. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier was trained on S t to predict which patients would respond to IO. For creating the model, the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> was used to select the top features. The same procedure using mRMR and LDA was performed for the comparative hand-crafted approaches. The ability to identify responders post-IO was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in S v .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The two top predictive TriAnGIL features were found to be the number of edges between stroma and CD4+ cells, and the number of edges between stroma and tumor cells with more interactions between stromal cells and both CD4+ and tumor cells being associated with response to IO. This finding is concordant with other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> that stromal TILs were significantly associated with improved OS. Therefore, TriAnGIL approach is not only predictive of treatment response but more critically it enables biological interpretations that a DL model might not be able to provide. In S v , this LDA classifier was able to distinguish responders from non-responders to IO with AU C T ri =0.  Design: S t was used to construct a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> regularized Cox proportional hazards model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> using the TriAnGIL features, to obtain risk score for each patient. LASSO features are listed in supplemental Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. The median risk score in S t was used as a threshold in both S t and S v to dichotomize patients into low-risk/high-risk categories. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> were plotted and the model performance was summarized by hazard ratio (HR), with corresponding (95% confidence intervals (CI)) using the log-rank test, and Harrell's concordance index (C-index) on S v . The C-index evaluates the correlation between risk predictions and survival times, aiming to maximize the discrimination between high-risk and low-risk patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. OS is the time between the initiation of IO to the death of the patient. The patients were censored if the date of death was unknown.</p><p>Result: Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> presents some TriAnGIL features in a field of view for a patient with long-term survival and another with short-term survival. More triangular relationships, shorter triangle edges, and smaller triangles with smaller perimeters are found in the long-term survival case when analyzing the triadic interactions within tumor-stroma-CD4, thereby suggesting higher relative presence and closer interaction of these cell families. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> illustrates the KM plots for the six approaches. We also calculated the concordance index (C-index) for the two prognostic approaches in S v . The C-index for TriAnGIL and GNN methods were 0.64, and 0.63 respectively. Therefore, overall TriAnGIL worked marginally better than GNN, with much higher biological interpretability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Concluding Remarks</head><p>We presented a new approach, Triangular Analysis of Geographical Interplay of Lymphocytes (TriAnGIL), to quantitatively chartacterize the spatial arrangement and relative geographical interplay of multiple cell families across pathological images. Compared to previous spatial graph-based methods, TriAnGIL quantifies the spatial interplay between multiple cell families, providing a more comprehensive portrait of the tumor microenvironment. TriAnGIL was predictive of response after IO (N = 122) and also demonstrated a strong correlation with OS in NSCLC patients treated with IO (N = 135). TriAnGIL outperformed other graph-and DL-based approaches, with the added benefit of provoding interpretability with regard to the spatial interplay between cell families. For instance, TriAnGIL yielded the insight that more interactions between stromal cells and both CD4+ and tumor cells appears to be associated with better response to IO. Although five cell families were studies in this work, TriAnGIL is flexible and could include other cell types (e.g., macrophages). Future work will entail larger validation studies and also evaluation on other use cases.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Algorithm 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Finding Triangles INPUT: A jagged array Del : Delaunay graph with three vertices of every triangle in each row, A hashmap φ : maps nodes to their type OUTPUT: Triangle features T riF eatSet let T riIndex ← ∅ be the list for triangle indices for i = 1 to i = length(Del) do let Marker ← ∅ be a auxiliary list to keep the viewed markers for j = 1 to 3 do if φ(Del(i, j)) / ∈ Marker then Marker ← Marker φ(Del(i, j)) end end if length(Marker) == 3 then T riIndex ← T riIndex i end end T riF eatSet ←GetTriangleFeatures(Del(T riIndex, :)) return T riF eatSet</figDesc></figure>
